You are building the new Shelf Asset Management marketing website.
This must be a world-class SaaS website: fast, clean, modern, brandable, and extremely easy to maintain and iterate.

Follow these architectural rules:
	1.	Use Next.js (latest version) with the “Next.js SaaS Starter” as the base.
	2.	Use TailwindCSS for all styling.
	3.	Use MDX for all content pages (landing text, features, case studies, blog posts, concepts).
	4.	All content must live in /content/** as .mdx files with frontmatter.
	5.	The design should feel inspired by Vercel, Linear, Notion, and Arc Browser — clean, spacious, modern.
	6.	The codebase must be AI-friendly: fully readable, modular, and easy to refactor.
	7.	The final website must be deployable on Vercel with no configuration overhead.
