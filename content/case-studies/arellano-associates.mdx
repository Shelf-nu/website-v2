## The Challenge — When Outlook Stopped Scaling

Before Shelf, Arellano Associates used Outlook to book equipment. As the organization grew and events multiplied, the system's limitations became impossible to ignore.

> "Double bookings became common, there was limited visibility into who had what, and no good way to report lost or damaged items." — Jacky, Office & Events Coordinator

The organization frequently ran multiple simultaneous events with no central tracking system. Equipment accountability suffered, and coordinating resources across teams became unpredictable. High-demand items like tablets, Wi-Fi hotspots, wagons, and event carts were constantly in motion — and no one could see where they were.

## The Solution — Finding a System That Actually Works

The team evaluated multiple tools before selecting Shelf. What made the difference wasn't just features — it was the relationship.

> "Being able to work directly with the founders, get real human support, and see ongoing improvements to the product made a big difference." — Jacky, Office & Events Coordinator

Implementation included integrating Shelf into the employee onboarding process, so new hires learn the system from their very first day. This ensured adoption wasn't an afterthought — it became part of the culture.

## The Transformation — From Guesswork to Visibility

### Equipment Management Became Second Nature

Reservations, checkouts, and returns became routine. Event planning improved through complete visibility into availability and ownership.

> "That visibility has reduced confusion, improved accountability, and made it easier to plan ahead when equipment is limited." — Jacky, Office & Events Coordinator

### High-Demand Items, Always Tracked

Tablets, Wi-Fi hotspots, wagons, and carts now have real-time location visibility across simultaneous events.

> "Knowing exactly where those items are and which team has them — especially when multiple events are happening at the same time — has made a big difference." — Jacky, Office & Events Coordinator

## Results — When Shelf Saved the Day

The impact became crystal clear during an Orange County community meeting. The venue's projector stopped working mid-meeting. Within minutes, the team checked Shelf, confirmed a backup projector was available, and resolved the crisis on the spot — no scrambling, no guesswork, no delays.

That moment captured exactly what Shelf delivers: the confidence to handle the unexpected because you always know what's available and where it is.
