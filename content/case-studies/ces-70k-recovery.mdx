## The challenge

CES Utility Solutions works in extreme field environments: remote transmission lines, rough terrain, substations, wildfire-risk areas. Their team transports critical drone kits and specialized inspection equipment that must stay accounted for.

One such kit — a drone case with **about $70,000** of equipment inside — was lost when a security strap on their truck failed.

**Operational risk:**

- $70k direct replacement cost  
- Project delays for utility clients  
- Loss of calibrated gear that’s difficult to re-provision  
- Safety & compliance impacts

## The solution

CES labels all critical gear using **Shelf QR asset labels** combined with the platform’s **Found-via-Scan workflow**:

- A durable QR label ties each case to its Shelf asset profile  
- Anyone scanning the label sees a lightweight **“Found an Item?”** web form  
- Shelf instantly notifies CES with the finder’s message

The workflow requires **no app** and works from **any phone camera**, making it ideal for equipment that travels far outside controlled environments.

## What happened

> “Shelf recently saved a piece of critical equipment for us. A security strap on our truck failed and one of our cases, containing $70k worth of drone equipment, was lost. Someone found it and scanned the Shelf QR code on the outside of the case, putting them in contact with us, and we were able to recover the kit. This prevented us from falling behind on our commitment to our clients and saved us the cost of replacing the equipment.” — Levi Seese, Asset Manager, CES Utility Solutions

‍

The finder scanned the label, submitted the “found” form, and CES immediately received an alert. Within hours, the team recovered the full kit.

## Impact

- **$70,000 avoided loss** (direct replacement cost)  
- **Zero friction** for the finder — scan → submit → done  
- **Operational continuity preserved** — no need to reschedule crews  
- **Long-term ROI:** One recovery covers years of Shelf usage

**ROI snapshot:** One QR scan paid for the entire asset tracking program.

## Why this works for utility field teams

Field equipment tracking demands:

- **Durable labels** that survive transport and weather  
- **Fast scanning** with any device  
- **Real-time alerts** when equipment is found  
- **Simple onboarding** for contractors & partner teams

Shelf’s QR labels and public “found item” workflows match exactly how utility and drone operators work in the real world.

## Implementation notes

![](https://qliecghuzfchfjwaisyx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/website-images/case-studies/CES+Truck+2.webp)

- CES began with priority assets, labeling drone kits, cases, and field tools  
- The team adopted “unclaimed” QR codes for fast intake of new equipment  
- Shelf shipped improvements based on CES feedback (camera selection, image upload UX)
