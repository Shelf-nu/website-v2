# How CES Utility Solutions Recovered Critical Drone Equipment Using Shelf’s QR Labels & Found-via-Scan Workflow

CES Utility Solutions performs UAS/drone inspections in some of the harshest field environments: remote transmission lines, rugged terrain, substations, and wildfire-risk zones.

They rely on high-value, specialized drone kits that must remain accounted for to meet client deadlines and safety requirements.

One lost case could cost tens of thousands of dollars—and delay critical inspection work.

---

## At a Glance

- **Customer:** CES Utility Solutions (cooperes.com)  
- **Industry:** Utility infrastructure inspection (UAS/drone), data capture & analytics  
- **Primary use cases:** Field equipment tracking, QR labeling, lost-item recovery  
- **Highlight:** A complete drone kit (~$70k) was recovered after a passerby scanned Shelf’s QR label and submitted a *found* report.

---

## The Challenge

CES teams transport drone cases and equipment across remote and industrial environments. During one job, a security strap on their truck failed—sending a drone case containing **$70,000 of gear** onto the roadside.

The risks were immediate:

- **$70k direct replacement cost**  
- **Project delays for utility clients**  
- **Loss of calibrated equipment** that cannot be easily re-provisioned  
- **Safety & compliance impact** if inspections were postponed  

The case was missing for nearly a month.

## The Shelf Solution: QR Labels + Found-via-Scan Workflow

CES labels all critical gear using **Shelf QR asset labels**, enabling two key capabilities:

1. **A QR code ties each case to its Shelf asset profile**  
2. **Anyone scanning it sees a lightweight “Found an Item?” form**  
3. **Shelf instantly notifies CES with the finder’s message**

No app download required.  
Works with any phone camera.  
Perfect for equipment in uncontrolled environments.

## What Happened

> **“Shelf recently saved a piece of critical equipment for us.  
> A security strap on our truck failed and one of our cases, containing $70k worth of drone equipment, was lost.  
> Someone found it and scanned the Shelf QR code on the outside of the case, putting them in contact with us, and we were able to recover the kit.”**  
> — *Levi Seese, Asset Manager, CES Utility Solutions*

The finder scanned the label, submitted the form, and CES immediately received an alert.  
Within hours, the team recovered the full kit—avoiding heavy operational losses.

---

## Impact

- **$70,000 loss avoided**  
- **Zero friction for the finder** — scan → submit → done  
- **Operational continuity preserved** — no missed inspections  
- **Long-term ROI:** one recovery pays for years of Shelf usage  

### ROI Snapshot  
**One QR scan paid for the entire asset tracking program.**

---

## Why This Works for Utility Field Teams

Field operations require:

- **Durable labels** that survive weather & transport  
- **Fast scanning** with any device  
- **Real-time alerts** when equipment is found  
- **Simple onboarding** for contractors & partner vendors  

Shelf’s workflows match how field teams already operate.

CES followed a practical rollout strategy:

- Labeled all drone kits, cases, and field gear  
- Used **unclaimed QR codes** for rapid intake of new items  
- Provided product feedback that helped Shelf improve camera selection & upload UX
