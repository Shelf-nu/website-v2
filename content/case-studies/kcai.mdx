## The Challenge: Migration Without Disruption

When Kansas City Art Institute's Media Center decided to migrate from Cheqroom to Shelf, they faced a critical challenge that confronts many organizations during software transitions: **how to upgrade their asset management system without losing existing investments in hardware and workflows**.

The Media Center had built an efficient operation around their [DYMO LabelWriter 550 printers](https://store.shelf.nu), which integrated seamlessly with Cheqroom's system to generate QR code labels with a single click. This workflow was essential for managing the substantial inventory of equipment that students check out for creative projects.

> "We use a DYMO LabelWriter 550 to print labels for all of our items. This was a holdover from our time with Cheqroom as their system could print labels to a DYMO template/printer with one click. This was really convenient and a great investment." – Steve Gardels, Manager of the Media Center

The stakes were high: any disruption to their [equipment check-out process](https://www.shelf.nu/solutions/educational-resource-management) during the busy semester could impact hundreds of student projects and creative work.

## The Technical Hurdle

During the migration process, the team encountered an unexpected technical challenge. Their existing QR codes, generated through DYMO Connect software, worked perfectly with phone cameras and correctly linked to Shelf URLs. However, these codes **weren't being detected by Shelf's internal scanner** during the crucial "[Scan to Add](https://www.shelf.nu/blog/introducing-qr-scan-to-add-transforming-asset-bookings)" process when creating new bookings.

This threatened to disrupt their most important workflow: quickly adding equipment to [bookings](https://www.shelf.nu/features/bookings) by scanning QR codes.

### Methodical Problem-Solving

The KCAI team approached troubleshooting systematically:

- Extracted [QR IDs](/features) from Shelf's system
- Used spreadsheet functions to format URLs correctly
- Created [CSV files](https://docs.shelf.nu) for DYMO Connect batch processing
- Generated test labels that worked with regular QR scanners
- Validated that URLs pointed to correct assets
- Tested multiple camera configurations and settings

Despite these thorough efforts, Shelf's internal scanner still wasn't recognizing their custom-generated codes.

## Shelf's Solution: Technology Adapts to You

Rather than asking KCAI to abandon their existing workflow and hardware investment, **Shelf took a different approach: we enhanced our technology to work with their system**.

Our development team updated Shelf's [QR code scanning capabilities](/features) to better accommodate externally generated codes, including those from DYMO's label printing software. This solution delivered immediate benefits:

- **Zero additional hardware costs** – KCAI kept their DYMO investment
- **Maintained familiar workflows** – Staff didn't need retraining
- **Preserved efficiency** – One-click label printing continued
- **Enhanced functionality** – Gained Shelf's advanced [booking system](https://www.shelf.nu/features/bookings)
- **Seamless semester transition** – No disruption to student services

## The Results: Upgraded Capability, Preserved Investment

### Immediate Operational Benefits

- **Continued equipment lending operations** without missing a beat during the transition
- **Batch scanning functionality** for efficient [booking creation](https://www.shelf.nu/features/bookings)
- **Preserved staff expertise** with familiar DYMO label workflows
- **Enhanced booking capabilities** with Shelf's advanced [scheduling system](https://www.shelf.nu/features/dashboard)

### Long-term Strategic Value

- **Future-proof solution:** Any organization using external QR generation can now integrate seamlessly
- **Scalable approach:** Works with various [label printing systems](https://store.shelf.nu) beyond just DYMO
- **Cost optimization:** Protected existing hardware investment while gaining advanced [features](https://www.shelf.nu/features)

## Technical Implementation Guide

For other [educational institutions](https://www.shelf.nu/solutions/educational-resource-management) looking to implement similar solutions:

### QR Code Requirements

- **URL Format:** https://eam.sh/[QR ID]
- **Compatibility:** Works with standard QR code generation software
- **Validation:** Test with both phone cameras and [Shelf's built-in scanner](/features)

### Hardware Compatibility

- Functions across various camera types and scanning environments
- Compatible with major [label printers](https://store.shelf.nu) (DYMO, Brother, Zebra)
- Supports batch generation through [CSV imports](https://docs.shelf.nu)

### Best Practices

- Maintain consistent URL structure across all generated codes
- Test codes in your actual working environment before full deployment
- Use proper [CSV formatting](https://www.shelf.nu/blog/industry-specific-csv-import-examples) for batch label generation
- Document your workflow for future team members

## Why This Matters for Your Organization

KCAI's experience demonstrates a crucial principle: **the right technology partner adapts to your needs rather than forcing you to adapt to theirs**.

When evaluating [asset management solutions](https://www.shelf.nu/better-asset-management), consider:

- **Integration flexibility:** Will the new system work with your existing hardware?
- **Migration support:** How does the vendor handle transition challenges?
- **Total cost of ownership:** What's the real cost including potential hardware replacement?
- **Workflow preservation:** Can you maintain efficient processes your team already knows?

## The Broader Impact

While this enhancement was initially driven by KCAI's needs, it has benefited the entire Shelf community. Now any organization using:

- [DYMO or other label printing systems](https://store.shelf.nu)
- Custom [QR code generation](/features) software
- Existing labeling workflows
- Legacy hardware investments

...can seamlessly integrate with Shelf without sacrificing their existing setup.

> "When institutions trust us with their transition to Shelf, we're committed to making that transition as smooth as possible. Sometimes that means adapting our technology to work with their existing systems rather than the other way around." – Carlos Virreira, CEO, Shelf Asset Management

## Looking Forward

KCAI's successful migration showcases what's possible when technology companies prioritize customer success over rigid system requirements. The Media Center now enjoys:

- All the advanced features of [Shelf's asset management platform](https://www.shelf.nu/features)
- Continued use of their familiar and efficient labeling workflow
- A solution that grows with their needs
- Confidence in their technology partner's commitment to their success

For other [educational institutions](https://www.shelf.nu/solutions/educational-resource-management), creative organizations, and equipment-heavy operations considering a migration, KCAI's experience proves that you don't have to choose between better software and preserving your existing investments.

The right partner will find a way to give you both.
