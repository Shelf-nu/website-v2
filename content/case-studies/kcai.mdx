# Kansas City Art Institute: Seamless Migration from Cheqroom to Shelf

When Kansas City Art Institute’s Media Center decided to move from Cheqroom to Shelf, the stakes were high:

- a large inventory of student-loan equipment  
- carefully tuned check-out workflows  
- and a significant investment in DYMO label printers and templates.

The goal wasn’t just “new software.” It was **modernizing asset management without disrupting students or replacing hardware that already worked well**.

> “We use a DYMO LabelWriter 550 to print labels for all of our items. This was a holdover from our time with Cheqroom as their system could print labels to a DYMO template/printer with one click. This was really convenient and a great investment.”
>
> — *Steve Gardels, Manager of the Media Center*

Shelf had to fit into that world — not force KCAI to start from scratch.

## About Kansas City Art Institute

![Kansas City Art Institute printmaking studio](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/641c35b7e5057648c76fa79f/67aa1ba2c258695b6bd94483_Printmaking_Studio.original.jpg)

Kansas City Art Institute (KCAI) is a private art school with over 1,500 students specializing in fine arts, design, and media arts.

The **Media Center** manages a large inventory of cameras, lenses, audio gear, lighting, and production accessories that students rely on for coursework, personal projects, and collaborations.

- **Students:** 1,500+  
- **Use case:** Equipment lending for creative projects  
- **Expectation:** Reliable, fast check-outs that don’t get in the way of making work

---

## The challenge: Migration without disruption

KCAI’s Media Center had already invested deeply in their previous setup:

- **DYMO LabelWriter 550 printers** deployed and configured  
- Label templates tuned for their shelving, cases, and inventory  
- A one-click workflow that generated QR labels through Cheqroom

When they decided to move to Shelf, they faced a familiar migration problem:

> How do we **upgrade** our asset management platform **without** throwing away working hardware, label designs, and established staff habits?

The priority was clear:

- Keep labels printing from **DYMO**  
- Keep labels **scannable by any phone**  
- Gain Shelf’s **modern workflows** for bookings, custody, and tracking  
- Avoid a painful, disruptive “rip and replace” implementation

---

## The technical hurdle

On paper, the migration looked straightforward:

- KCAI generated QR codes using DYMO Connect and existing templates  
- Those codes pointed to valid Shelf short URLs (`https://eam.sh/[QR-ID]`)  
- Phone cameras could scan them and open the correct Shelf asset pages

But there was a hidden problem.

During booking workflows — especially **Scan to Add** when building reservations — Shelf’s **internal scanner** wasn’t consistently detecting these externally generated codes, even though they worked fine in regular camera apps.

That meant the most important workflow for the Media Center — **quickly scanning items into bookings** — was at risk.

The options were:

1. Ask KCAI to abandon DYMO and start over  
2. Force staff to change their label process mid-semester  
3. Or adapt Shelf so it could **work with** KCAI’s existing labels

Shelf chose option 3.

## How Shelf adapted to KCAI — not the other way around

Instead of asking KCAI to redesign their labels or replace hardware, Shelf’s team changed the product.

Engineering focused on:

- Improving the robustness of the **built-in QR scanner**  
- Ensuring compatibility with QR codes generated by DYMO Connect  
- Validating that any QR that opens a valid Shelf URL can also be used in **Scan to Add** flows

From KCAI’s perspective, the outcome was simple:

- **No hardware changes**  
- **No label redesign**  
- **No major re-training of staff**  
- Their DYMO LabelWriter 550s kept doing exactly what they were good at: printing QR labels with a single click.

Behind the scenes, Shelf’s scanning pipeline became more tolerant and flexible — not just for KCAI, but for any customer generating QR codes externally.

## The new workflow with Shelf

With the scanner compatibility solved, KCAI’s Media Center could combine:

- **Existing hardware & labels**  
- **New Shelf workflows**  
- **A smoother experience for students & staff**

### 1. Asset import & labeling

- Assets are created or imported into Shelf  
- QR IDs are associated with each asset  
- DYMO Connect generates labels pointing to Shelf’s short URLs  
- Labels are applied to cameras, lenses, kits, and accessories

### 2. Check-outs and bookings

Using Shelf’s **booking workflows** and device-friendly UI:

- Staff scan QR labels to add items to a booking  
- Students check gear in and out based on clear reservations  
- Everyone sees what’s booked, what’s available, and what’s overdue

- [Asset Tracking](/solutions/asset-tracking)  
- [Camera Equipment Check-Out](/solutions/camera-equipment-check-out)

### 3. Day-to-day operations

Because the **core label workflow didn’t change**, adoption focused on:

- Learning Shelf’s interface, not rebuilding their process from scratch  
- Using Shelf as a **single source of truth** for what is where  
- Relying on scanning instead of manual typing or spreadsheets  

---

## Results: Upgrade in capability, not in chaos

### 1. Hardware investment preserved

KCAI kept their **DYMO LabelWriter 550** printers and existing label stock.

- No new hardware purchases  
- No wasted spend on previously installed printers  
- No need to re-train staff on an entirely new labeling system

### 2. Zero disruption to student workflows

Students and staff experienced:

- Familiar labels on gear  
- Faster check-outs and returns  
- Less friction during busy periods of the semester

### 3. Better bookings, same printers

By combining Shelf’s booking system with their existing labels, KCAI gained:

- Clear visibility into who has what, and when  
- Less manual coordination for equipment reservations  
- Reduced risk of double bookings or missed items  

### 4. A platform that grows with them

Shelf’s improvements for KCAI’s use case now benefit:

- Other schools using DYMO, Brother, Zebra, or similar printers  
- Teams generating QR codes through third-party software  
- Any organization that wants to bring its **own label workflow** to Shelf

This case became an internal pattern: when a customer has a proven workflow, Shelf aims to **meet them where they are** — and then help them go further.

## Lessons for other institutions

KCAI’s experience offers a few clear takeaways for other schools and media centers:

### 1. You don’t need to throw away what already works

If you’ve invested in:

- Label printers  
- Templates  
- Barcodes or QR codes  
- Staff training around a specific workflow  

You can still modernize your asset management layer without discarding all of that.

### 2. Evaluate partners on flexibility — not just features

When comparing tools like Cheqroom, Snipe-IT, or custom systems, ask:

- Will this platform work with our existing hardware?  
- How do they handle migration quirks?  
- Are they willing to ship improvements for real use cases — not just ideal demos?

### 3. Migrations are about people, not just data

For KCAI, success looked like:

- Staff not having to relearn label printing from scratch  
- Students enjoying smoother check-outs  
- Leadership seeing reduced risk, not extra complexity  

The best migration is the one that **barely feels like a migration** to your end users.

---

## Why this matters for Shelf

KCAI’s migration highlights a core principle of how Shelf evolves:

> The right product doesn’t just import your data — it respects your existing operational reality.

By adapting Shelf’s QR scanning to KCAI’s DYMO setup, we:

- Preserved a working hardware investment  
- Unblocked a critical booking workflow  
- Improved the product for every customer using external QR generation

This is the kind of quiet, high-leverage change that turns a tool into a long-term operational partner.

---

## Ready to modernize without starting over?

If you’re running:

- A media center  
- An equipment lending desk  
- A creative lab or AV department  

…and you’re worried that switching systems means rebuilding everything, KCAI’s story shows another path.

**You can keep what works — and still get a modern, workflow-first asset management platform.**
