## The Challenge

Acme Corp runs a tight ship, but their equipment management was leaking money. Handheld scanners, essential for their daily operations, were considered "consumables" because they disappeared so often.

## The Solution

Implementing Shelf was simple. The IT team printed durable QR asset tags and affixed them to every scanner. They set up "Check-out Kiosks" at the entrance of every warehouse.

## The Result

The culture changed overnight. Once employees knew that devices were assigned to them personally, they took better care of them.
