## Modernizing the Media Lab

Globex aims to provide a world-class education, but their administrative processes were stuck in the 90s. The paper-based checkout system for their state-of-the-art cameras was a bottleneck.

## Empowering Students

With Shelf, students now have a "shopping cart" experience for booking gear. They can see what's available in real-time and reserve it for their projects.
