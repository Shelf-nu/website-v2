# How HAARP Coordinates Multi-University Research Assets in the Alaskan Arctic with Shelf

Deep in the Alaskan wilderness, the **High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP)** operates one of the world's most advanced atmospheric research facilities. Their work involves measuring the Earth's upper atmosphere, magnetic field, and auroral activity — using highly specialized instruments contributed by **seven different research universities**.

These instruments vary wildly in form, data types, and operational parameters. Tracking them in spreadsheets was no longer viable.

Shelf became the first system capable of handling both the **complexity and diversity** of HAARP’s scientific equipment.

---

## At a Glance

- **7 collaborating universities**
- **Multiple instrument types:**  
  - Aurora observation cameras  
  - Solar radio burst receivers  
  - Atmospheric radar systems  
  - Magnetometers  
- **Key operational goals:**  
  - Shared visibility  
  - Detailed technical parameter tracking  
  - Centralized troubleshooting  
  - Reliable search & filtering  

---

## The Challenge: Multi-Institution, Multi-Instrument Chaos

HAARP hosts permanent research installations from global universities. Each instrument has its own specifications and scientific purpose:

### Example parameters HAARP must track:
- **Cameras:** shutter speed, focal length, sensor resolution  
- **Radio receivers:** operating frequency, bandwidth, directionality  
- **Radar systems:** ionospheric measurement configuration  
- **Magnetometers:** sampling rates, calibration values  

This complexity made spreadsheet management nearly impossible.

> **“Trying to track things like this in a spreadsheet quickly becomes very cumbersome, and leaves you with a database that can’t be easily searched or filtered.”**  
> — *Evans Callis, Research Support Services Lead, HAARP*

Troubleshooting was equally difficult:  
Long email chains, scattered commands, differing workflows between institutions.

---

## The Evaluation: Searching for Flexibility

HAARP evaluated several systems, including university-wide asset systems and Snipe-IT.

None could handle:

- Multi-institution collaboration  
- Different data structures for each instrument type  
- Searchability based on technical parameters  
- Field-ready access to diagnostic instructions  

Shelf became the clear choice.

## Why HAARP Chose Shelf

> **“We decided that Shelf offered the most modern experience and most user-friendly setup of the options available to us, as well as the most flexibility for our needs.”**

### Key reasons:
### **1. Flexible Custom Fields**
Each instrument type requires different metadata.  
Shelf allows HAARP to create **distinct parameter sets** per asset type.

### **2. Embedded Troubleshooting Knowledge**
HAARP stores:
- diagnostic commands  
- network instructions  
- troubleshooting steps  
- operational checklists  

…all directly inside the asset profile.

### **3. Unified Search Across All Universities**
Researchers can search based on:
- frequency  
- bandwidth  
- optical parameters  
- instrument categories  
- condition or maintenance state  

### **4. QR Code Verification**
In remote field conditions, staff scan a label to instantly confirm:
- They’re handling the correct instrument  
- They have the right configuration  
- They can access diagnostic info instantly  

This is crucial when working in harsh Alaskan conditions.

## How HAARP Uses Shelf Beyond Basic Tracking

### **Smart Categorization**
HAARP uses tagging to group instruments into meaningful scientific categories while still maintaining unique data structures.

### **Facility Space Management**
Location tracking helps optimize:
- indoor/outdoor rack space  
- observatory & sensor station capacity  
- environmental exposure zones  

### **Field Operations**
Shelf becomes a companion tool in active research environments.

> **“This gives our staff the ability to confirm they’re working with the correct instrument and pull up all relevant information quickly and easily.”**

---

## Measuring Success

HAARP uses two primary metrics to evaluate Shelf:

### **1. Coordination Efficiency**
Can all universities understand:
- what equipment is onsite?
- what state it’s in?
- whether it’s operational?  
- what parameters matter?

### **2. Troubleshooting Traceability**
Does the asset contain:
- command logs?  
- diagnostic outputs?  
- field repair notes?  

Shelf satisfies both — and unifies teams across institutions.

---

## Looking Forward

HAARP expects even greater operational clarity as more researchers adopt Shelf’s workflows. The facility serves as a model for how **complex, multi-institution scientific environments** can overcome chaos through structured, flexible asset management.

Shelf is no longer just a tracker — it’s an **operational knowledge system** for Arctic research.
