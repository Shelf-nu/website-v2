## At a glance

- **Eliminated** "difficult if not impossible" asset searches across 4,000+ items
- **Reduced** equipment location time from facility-wide searches to maximum 10 devices per search
- **Streamlined** WFH equipment processes from complex spreadsheets to one-scan operations
- **Improved** purchasing decisions through complete asset visibility
- **Enhanced** IT team efficiency and operations compliance

## ResQ - Connections that count

ResQ is a thriving contact center operation managing substantial equipment infrastructure across two geographically distant sites. With over 4,000 assets including PCs, headsets, monitors, and specialized equipment, ResQ supports hundreds of agents across multiple campaigns while maintaining flexible hot-desking environments where any agent can work from any workstation.

**Headquarters:** Kingston Upon Hull, East Yorkshire, United Kingdom
**Industry:** Contact Center Operations
**Sites:** 2 locations with substantial distance between them
**Assets:** 4,000+ managed devices

We spoke with Toby Liversedge, IT Deskside Supervisor at ResQ, about how Shelf transformed their asset management from cumbersome spreadsheet tracking to a streamlined system that supports their growing operations.

## The Challenge: Geographic Complexity Meets Rapid Growth

ResQ faced the perfect storm of asset management challenges that plague growing contact centers:

**Multi-Site Complexity**: "We have 2 sites with a substantial distance between them. In both sites we have equipment regularly being taken and returned as agents WFH," explains Toby.

**COVID Impact**: The rapid shift to work-from-home operations left ResQ with equipment scattered across locations. "We have a lot of kit taken when Covid hit which we are still struggling to locate."

**Scale Without Systems**: Managing over 4,000 assets manually created impossible situations. "Before SHELF finding one device out of over 4,000 was difficult if not impossible."

**Process Friction**: "Before SHELF we had agents and their TL's filling in spreadsheets with multiple data fields for taking the equipment out as well as in. It was a overly complicated process that resulted in a lot of instances where the forms weren't filled in, filled in incorrectly or Equipment taken without informing IT."

## The Solution: Mobile-First Asset Management

ResQ implemented Shelf's comprehensive asset management platform, focusing on mobile accessibility and custom field flexibility to match their unique operational needs.

### Smart Location Architecture

ResQ developed an innovative location system using Shelf's custom fields:

- **Color-coded zones**: Split each floor into Red, Green, Yellow, and Blue sections
- **Numbered banks**: Each section contains numbered equipment banks
- **Precise positioning**: "We only have a maximum of 10 PC's to scan to find a device"

### Mobile-Centric Operations

> "The phone app for me is the best feature. It allows my guys to easily update and track and source equipment without the need to carry around laptops, logging in and out each time."

### Streamlined WFH Management

The transformation from spreadsheet disorder to one-scan operations eliminated compliance issues:

> "With SHELF being able to allocate equipment out to agents with one simple phone scan has hugely improved the process, meaning not only is it easier for the IT team to manage WFH kit but as they no longer have to fill out lengthy forms OP's are always informing IT for WFH kit requests and returns."

## Results: From Disorder to Control

### Dramatic Location Efficiency

- **Before**: Searching through 4,000+ assets with no systematic approach
- **After**: Maximum 10 devices to scan per search using color-coded location system
- **Impact**: "Having SHELF has massively improved our ability to locate equipment"

### Process Transformation

- **Eliminated**: Complex multi-field spreadsheet processes
- **Implemented**: One-scan equipment checkout/return
- **Result**: 100% IT visibility into WFH equipment movements

### Purchasing Optimization

> "We aren't there yet but we are close to having every company asset on SHELF. This makes purchasing much easier and will prevent over and under purchasing of equipment."

### Operational Compliance

The simplified process improved team adherence: "OP's are always informing IT for WFH kit requests and returns" compared to the previous system where "Equipment taken without informing IT" was common.

## Key Features Driving Success

### 1. Custom Fields Flexibility

ResQ uses custom fields to capture contact center-specific information:

- PC Bank Location fields for precise positioning
- Equipment specifications relevant to hot-desking operations
- Troubleshooting information and diagnostic details

> "This is followed by the ability to create custom fields which allow us to add helpful details to each asset that we can use for indexing and report creation."

### 2. Mobile-First Design

Field teams prefer mobile access over traditional laptop-based systems, enabling real-time updates from anywhere in the facility.

### 3. Scalable Architecture

The system handles ResQ's substantial inventory while maintaining speed and usability across multiple sites and user types.

## Industry Application: Contact Center Best Practices

ResQ's success demonstrates how contact centers can overcome common operational challenges:

**Hot-Desking Environments**: Standardized equipment configurations work seamlessly with Shelf's tracking capabilities, enabling "any agent or TL can sit at any desk and the kit on the desk will be suitable to use, regardless of campaign."

**Multi-Site Operations**: Consistent processes and visibility work across geographic boundaries, solving the challenge of equipment coordination between distant locations.

**Work-From-Home Support**: Streamlined checkout processes ensure IT maintains visibility and control over distributed equipment while removing friction for operations teams.

**Growth Scalability**: As contact centers expand, Shelf's system grows with them, preventing the breakdown of manual tracking methods.

## Technical Integration Opportunities

While ResQ currently manages Shelf as a standalone system, they've identified future integration potential:

> "Currently it doesn't. We have to manually update the SHELF database with changes to kit and NRM information. We use Azure and Datto for our device / user information systems."

This represents an opportunity for organizations using similar technology stacks to achieve even greater efficiency through API integrations.

## Success Metrics: Measuring Impact

ResQ measures success through practical improvements:

- **Time Efficiency**: Elimination of "blind searching" across 4,000+ assets
- **Process Compliance**: 100% visibility into equipment movements
- **Purchasing Accuracy**: Better data for equipment acquisition decisions
- **Team Productivity**: IT staff spend less time on manual tracking, more time on strategic initiatives

## Looking Forward: Complete Asset Visibility

ResQ continues expanding their Shelf implementation toward complete organizational asset tracking. Their experience demonstrates that the right asset management system transforms not just equipment tracking, but entire operational workflows.

For other contact centers managing complex, multi-site operations with work-from-home requirements, ResQ's implementation provides a proven roadmap for achieving operational excellence while maintaining the flexibility demanded by modern business environments.
