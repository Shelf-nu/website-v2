# How ResQ Transformed Multi-Site Contact Center Asset Management Across 4,000+ Devices

ResQ is a fast-growing contact center operation managing thousands of IT assets across two geographically distant sites. Their teams support hundreds of agents across campaigns, flexible hot-desking environments, and large volumes of work-from-home equipment.

Before adopting Shelf, their asset operations were slow, error-prone, and nearly impossible to scale.

> **“Before SHELF finding one device out of over 4,000 was difficult if not impossible.”**  
> — *Toby Liversedge, IT Deskside Supervisor, ResQ*

Shelf replaced that chaos with clarity, speed, and real-time control.

---

## At a Glance

- **Industry:** Contact Center Operations  
- **Assets Managed:** 4,000+  
- **Sites:** 2 major facilities  
- **Primary challenges:** WFH tracking, IT visibility, multi-site coordination  
- **Key transformation:** From impossible searches → max 10 items per search  

---

## The Challenge: Scale, Complexity, and Work-From-Home Chaos

ResQ faced four major operational obstacles:

### **1. Multi-Site Complexity**
Equipment constantly moved between two distant locations.

### **2. Work-From-Home Scatter**
COVID forced rapid WFH deployment:
- Assets left the building
- Paper logs failed
- IT visibility vanished

### **3. 4,000+ Devices With No System**
Headsets, PCs, monitors, peripherals — all tracked manually.

**Zero accountability, zero searchability.**

### **4. Spreadsheet Paralysis**
Workflows depended on multi-field spreadsheets:

- Hard to fill  
- Frequently incorrect  
- Often ignored  

This created compliance problems, lost equipment, and IT bottlenecks.

---

## Why the Old System Failed

> **“Before SHELF we had agents and TLs filling in spreadsheets… often incorrectly or not at all.”**

Agents struggled with:
- Long forms  
- Manual data entry  
- Confusing processes  

IT struggled with:
- Missing information  
- No tracking trail  
- Zero real-time visibility  

---

## The Solution: Mobile-First Asset Management, Built for Operations

Shelf enabled ResQ to rebuild asset operations around simplicity, scanning, and searchability.

---

## Smart Location Architecture

ResQ created a highly structured location system using Shelf’s **custom fields**:

- **Color-coded zones**  
  - Red  
  - Green  
  - Yellow  
  - Blue  

- **Numbered banks** inside each zone  
- **Scanning workflow** that reduces search from 4,000+ devices to **a maximum of 10**  

This alone transformed their IT operations.

> **“We only have a maximum of 10 PCs to scan to find a device.”**

---

## The Mobile App: Fast, Scannable, Zero Friction

> **“The phone app for me is the best feature.”**

Technicians can now:
- Update locations instantly  
- Check out equipment with one scan  
- Update WFH allocations on the move  

No laptops, no forms, no delays.

---

## Streamlining Work-From-Home (WFH) Operations

The WFH process changed drastically:

### **Before Shelf**
- Long spreadsheets  
- Incorrect entries  
- Lost equipment  
- Agents taking items without informing IT  

### **After Shelf**
- One-scan checkout  
- One-scan return  
- Real-time allocation history  
- 100% visibility  

> **“OPs are always informing IT for WFH kit requests and returns.”**

Behavior changed because the process became effortless.

---

## Results: From Impossible Searches to Total Control

### **1. Searches Reduced From 4,000+ → Under 10**
This is the biggest operational win.

### **2. Spreadsheets Eliminated**
No more manual tracking  
→ fewer errors  
→ higher compliance  
→ faster IT workflows  

### **3. Better Purchasing Decisions**
> **“This makes purchasing much easier and will prevent over and under purchasing.”**

With visibility comes better budgeting.

### **4. Stronger IT Compliance**
WFH and in-office movements are now recorded automatically.

### **5. Higher Team Productivity**
IT spends less time on:
- Manual lookups  
- Searching for lost equipment  
- Fixing spreadsheet errors  

And more time on strategic work.

---

## Key Shelf Features Driving Success

### **1. Custom Fields**
ResQ stores:
- PC bank location  
- Diagnostic data  
- Operational notes  
- WFH assignment metadata  

### **2. Mobile-First Design**
Designed for real operations, not desk work.

### **3. Scalable Architecture**
Handles thousands of assets without performance issues.

---

## Industry Lessons: What Contact Centers Can Learn

### **Hot-Desking Compatibility**
Shelf supports standardized workstation configurations, so:

> **“Any agent can sit at any desk and the kit will be suitable regardless of campaign.”**

### **Multi-Site Coordination**
The same process works across every location — consistency wins.

### **WFH Visibility**
One-scan workflows solve what spreadsheets never could.

### **Growth Scalability**
As contact centers expand, Shelf prevents system collapse.

---

## Future Opportunities (API Integration)

ResQ currently updates some systems manually:

> “We use Azure and Datto for device/user information.”

Integrations would enable:
- Automated data sync  
- Lifecycle management  
- Real-time reconciliation  

Shelf provides the API foundation for this next step.

---

## Success Metrics

ResQ measures impact through:

- **Search time reduction**  
- **Process compliance increase**  
- **Purchasing accuracy**  
- **IT productivity gains**  
- **WFH movement traceability**  

Shelf delivers improvements across all metrics.

---

## The Takeaway

ResQ’s transformation shows how a modern, mobile-first asset system can:

- End equipment chaos  
- Restore IT control  
- Support multi-site scalability  
- Improve purchasing  
- Reduce operational friction  

Shelf didn't just digitize ResQ’s process — it changed their operational culture.
