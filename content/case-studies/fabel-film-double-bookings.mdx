# From Chaos to Clarity

### How Fabel Film Built a Bulletproof Production Workflow with Shelf

When your entire gear system lives in one person’s head, every vacation becomes a crisis.

For **Johannes van Beeck**, Technical Director at **Fabel Film**, that pressure finally snapped during a last-minute shoot when he couldn’t find *“one extra camera.”*

That moment of panic triggered a transformation—from fragile memory to scalable system.

## At a Glance

- **Zero double bookings** after moving to Shelf
- **Entire days of creative time regained** each month
- **Predictable, delegation-ready workflow** across all shoots
- **Real-time visibility** for producers, operators, and gaffers
- **Proactive accountability** replacing reactive firefighting

## About Fabel Film

![Fabel Film's HQ in Tilburg - The Netherlands.](https://qliecghuzfchfjwaisyx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/website-images/case-studies/wp18-1.jpeg)

Operating from **Tilburg, Netherlands**, Fabel Film embodies Brabants craftsmanship and tight-knit collaboration.

The 14-person in-house team scales to 30 + on set and controls every step of production—from concept to delivery.

> “We are a rather small team and work a lot together for a long time. We do almost everything in house.”‍— Johannes van Beeck, Technical Director

‍**Website:** [fabel.film
](https://www.fabel.film/)**Industry:** Commercial Video Production
**Assets Managed:** 238
**Shelf Plan:** Team (since 2023)

## The Challenge — When Memory Becomes a Liability

Before Shelf, equipment planning existed only in Johannes’ head.

> “Most gear planning took place in my head. I put all the gear needed for production on our shared team agenda.”— Johannes van Beeck, Technical Director

That worked until productions overlapped.

A forgotten note, a misread calendar entry—and suddenly two shoots needed the same camera.

> “Avoiding double bookings is the reason I wanted to use Shelf. The moment I had to fix a last-minute extra camera proved to be stressful enough to encourage us to make this improvement.”— Johannes van Beeck, Technical Director

The hidden costs were brutal: lost time, constant interruptions, and the risk of disappointing clients. Every project relied on one person’s memory; every delay dented professional trust.

## The Solution — Turning Tribal Knowledge into Team Visibility

Johannes discovered Shelf through a friend—conveniently, Shelf’s founder Carlos Virreira—but he was already searching for structure.

> “I discovered Shelf through my friend Carlos. I was looking for an asset management tool for our video production company.”‍— Johannes van Beeck, Technical Director

‍

Implementation took patience, not persuasion.

> “It took some time. Change always needs time. There was no resistance from the team. But our people needed to implement it their workflows.”‍— Johannes van Beeck, Technical Director

### The Game-Changer: Bookings with Kits

> “Bookings with kits work very well for us. Making sure there is no double booking as one asset can belong to only 1 kit at a time.”— Johannes van Beeck, Technical Director

That feature alone turned Shelf into the operational backbone of the company—one screen showing who has what, when, and why.

### The Transformation — From Bottlenecks to Bulletproof Shoots

Before Shelf, a single person carried the system:

- Gear tracked in memory and paper notes
- Producers dependent on Johannes for availability
- Double bookings, forgotten gear, and late preps
- Broken equipment discovered on set

After Shelf, the workflow became a shared discipline:

- **Producers** start bookings with essentials
- **Technical crew** adds specialized gear
- **Operators** prep directly from digital lists
- **Anyone** can finalize gear the day before
- **Real-time status** eliminates overlap and confusion

> “Now multiple personnel can make a reservation for what they need for a shoot. Or a producer can start a booking and ask a technical person to add stuff. Way more streamlined than before, and more asynchronous.”— Johannes van Beeck, Technical Director

The result isn’t just convenience—it’s resilience.

Shelf ensures that every project can run smoothly even when Johannes isn’t in the building.

## Results — Predictability Over Panic

### Zero Double Bookings

The nightmare that once defined their workflow is gone.

Every shoot now begins with certainty: the right gear, on time, every time.

> Shelf turned “I think” into “we know.”— Johannes van Beeck, Technical Director

### Days of Creative Time Recovered

Time saved on planning, and having no worries compunds into **entire days of reclaimed creative energy each month**.

Those hours no longer vanish into planning chaos—they fuel better shoots, faster turnarounds, and new ideas.

> “After the reservation is done, practically anyone in our team can take care of preparing gear for shoot-days or long shoots.”— Johannes van Beeck, Technical Director

Delegation used to be risky; now it’s built into the system.

### Reliability as Culture

> “We experience less missing gear for sure! Also our staff writes activity notes if stuff is broken so I don’t find out on the next set. No surprises”— Johannes van Beeck, Technical Director

Shelf didn’t just digitize assets—it changed behavior.

Team members now report damage proactively and share responsibility for readiness.

The workflow itself enforces professionalism.

## Why This Matters

![Asset availability mode - Shelf.nu](https://qliecghuzfchfjwaisyx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/website-images/case-studies/6852997b2b79b4c6c5a5fa91_availability-1.jpg)

In production, reliability **is** reputation.

One missing light, one late setup, one double booking—and a client’s confidence evaporates.

Fabel Film’s transformation replaced uncertainty with control.

Johannes no longer operates as the bottleneck; he operates as the creative lead again.

> “It takes some time to implement. But it’s more than worth it.”— Johannes van Beeck, Technical Director

## Lessons for Other Studios

- **Adoption takes time—but the payoff is exponential.**
- **Start with your biggest pain point.** Double bookings usually hide deeper chaos.
- **Empower collaboration.** Visibility builds accountability.
- **Treat process as brand protection.** Clients feel the difference when prep is flawless.

## From Dependence to Freedom

By shifting from a memory-based process to a transparent system, Fabel Film unlocked two kinds of growth:

**Operational Resilience**

- No single point of failure
- Consistent pre-production rhythm
- Easier hand-offs and delegation

‍**Creative Freedom**‍

- Fewer interruptions for the technical lead
- More time for storytelling and craft
- Teamwide confidence every shoot will launch on schedule

## Ready to Eliminate Chaos?

Fabel Film proves that even small, close-knit teams can achieve enterprise-level reliability.

Shelf isn’t about tracking gear—it’s about protecting your reputation and giving your creatives their time back.
