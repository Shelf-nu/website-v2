# From Chaos to Clarity

### How Fabel Film Built a Bulletproof Production Workflow with Shelf

When your entire gear system lives in one person's head, every vacation becomes a crisis.

For **Johannes van Beeck**, Technical Director at **Fabel Film**, that pressure finally snapped during a last-minute shoot when he couldn't find *"one extra camera."*

That moment of panic triggered a transformation—from fragile memory to scalable system.

## About Fabel Film

![Fabel Film HQ in Tilburg](https://qliecghuzfchfjwaisyx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/website-images/case-studies/wp18-1.jpeg)
*Fabel Film's HQ in Tilburg - The Netherlands.*

Operating from **Tilburg, Netherlands**, Fabel Film embodies Brabants craftsmanship and tight-knit collaboration.

The 14-person in-house team scales to 30+ on set and controls every step of production—from concept to delivery.

> "We are a rather small team and work a lot together for a long time. We do almost everything in house."
>
> — *Johannes van Beeck, Technical Director*

**Website:** [fabel.film](https://www.fabel.film/)  
**Industry:** Commercial Video Production  
**Assets Managed:** 238  
**Shelf Plan:** Team (since 2023)

## The Challenge — When Memory Becomes a Liability

Before Shelf, equipment planning existed only in Johannes' head.

> "Most gear planning took place in my head. I put all the gear needed for production on our shared team agenda."
>
> — *Johannes van Beeck, Technical Director*

That worked until productions overlapped.

A forgotten note, a misread calendar entry—and suddenly two shoots needed the same camera.

> "Avoiding double bookings is the reason I wanted to use Shelf. The moment I had to fix a last-minute extra camera proved to be stressful enough to encourage us to make this improvement."
>
> — *Johannes van Beeck, Technical Director*

The hidden costs were brutal: lost time, constant interruptions, and the risk of disappointing clients. Every project relied on one person's memory; every delay dented professional trust.

## The Solution — Turning Tribal Knowledge into Team Visibility

Johannes discovered Shelf through a friend—conveniently, Shelf's founder Carlos Virreira—but he was already searching for structure.

> "I discovered Shelf through my friend Carlos. I was looking for an asset management tool for our video production company."
>
> — *Johannes van Beeck, Technical Director*

Implementation took patience, not persuasion.

> "It took some time. Change always needs time. There was no resistance from the team. But our people needed to implement it their workflows."
>
> — *Johannes van Beeck, Technical Director*

### The Game-Changer: Bookings with Kits

> "Bookings with kits work very well for us. Making sure there is no double booking as one asset can belong to only 1 kit at a time."
>
> — *Johannes van Beeck, Technical Director*

That feature alone turned Shelf into the operational backbone of the company—one screen showing who has what, when, and why.

## The Transformation — From Bottlenecks to Bulletproof Shoots

**Before Shelf:**

- Gear tracked in memory and paper notes
- Producers dependent on Johannes for availability
- Double bookings, forgotten gear, and late preps
- Broken equipment discovered on set

**After Shelf:**

- **Producers** start bookings with essentials
- **Technical crew** adds specialized gear
- **Operators** prep directly from digital lists
- **Anyone** can finalize gear the day before
- **Real-time status** eliminates overlap and confusion

> "Now multiple personnel can make a reservation for what they need for a shoot. Or a producer can start a booking and ask a technical person to add stuff. Way more streamlined than before, and more asynchronous."
>
> — *Johannes van Beeck, Technical Director*

The result isn't just convenience—it's resilience.

Shelf ensures that every project can run smoothly even when Johannes isn't in the building.

## Results — Predictability Over Panic

### Zero Double Bookings

The nightmare that once defined their workflow is gone.

Every shoot now begins with certainty: the right gear, on time, every time.

> Shelf turned *"I think"* into *"we know."*
>
> — *Johannes van Beeck, Technical Director*

### Days of Creative Time Recovered

Time saved on planning, and having no worries compounds into **entire days of reclaimed creative energy each month**.

Those hours no longer vanish into planning chaos—they fuel better shoots, faster turnarounds, and new ideas.

> "After the reservation is done, practically anyone in our team can take care of preparing gear for shoot-days or long shoots."
>
> — *Johannes van Beeck, Technical Director*

Delegation used to be risky; now it's built into the system.

### Reliability as Culture

> "We experience less missing gear for sure! Also our staff writes activity notes if stuff is broken so I don't find out on the next set. No surprises"
>
> — *Johannes van Beeck, Technical Director*

Shelf didn't just digitize assets—it changed behavior.

Team members now report damage proactively and share responsibility for readiness.

The workflow itself enforces professionalism.

## Why This Matters

![Asset availability view in Shelf](https://qliecghuzfchfjwaisyx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/website-images/blog/6852997b2b79b4c6c5a5fa91_availability-1.jpg)
*Asset availability mode - Shelf.nu*

In production, reliability **is** reputation.

One missing light, one late setup, one double booking—and a client's confidence evaporates.

Fabel Film's transformation replaced uncertainty with control.

Johannes no longer operates as the bottleneck; he operates as the creative lead again.

> "It takes some time to implement. But it's more than worth it."
>
> — *Johannes van Beeck, Technical Director*

---

## Lessons for Other Studios

1. **Adoption takes time—but the payoff is exponential.**
2. **Start with your biggest pain point.** Double bookings usually hide deeper chaos.
3. **Empower collaboration.** Visibility builds accountability.
4. **Treat process as brand protection.** Clients feel the difference when prep is flawless.
