# Location Tracking

Equipment moves constantly—between buildings, rooms, trucks, sets, labs, and campuses. Without a simple way to track location changes, items go missing, teams get confused, and operations slow down.

Shelf provides fast, QR-driven location tracking that works with how teams actually move equipment.

---

## Why Location Tracking Matters

Location updates are essential when:

- gear moves across classrooms or production rooms  
- tools travel across field sites or trucks  
- equipment is shared across departments  
- AV carts float across campus  
- devices are stored in rotating physical spaces  

When teams rely on memory or spreadsheets, accuracy collapses.

## How Location Tracking Works in Shelf

### Scan → Update Location
Users scan an asset and select its current room, site, or building.

### Structured Location Hierarchy
Organize locations into:

- buildings  
- floors  
- rooms  
- zones  
- trucks  
- sets  

### Movement History
Every change is logged, giving you a clear trail of movement.

### Works With Custody
Location and custody complement each other:

- custody = who is responsible  
- location = where it is  

### Perfect for Field Teams
Easily record asset moves across field sites or vehicles.

---

## Workflow Example

1. Technician scans a tool at a job site.  
2. Shelf updates the location to “Truck 12” or “Site A.”  
3. Later, gear is brought to a workshop → new scan updates location.  
4. Dashboard shows the latest position across all assets.  

This is equally useful for classrooms, studios, labs, and warehouses.
