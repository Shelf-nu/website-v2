# Location Tracking

Location tracking lets you know where every asset is—across rooms, buildings, job sites, and vehicles—with quick updates and clear visibility.

## What Location Tracking Solves

Without clear location tracking, organizations struggle with:

- **Equipment misplaced**: Items end up in the wrong room, closet, or site with no record.
- **Departments not knowing where items are stored**: Each team maintains separate mental models of where things should be.
- **Job site confusion**: Tools and gear move constantly, and no one knows what's where.
- **Mixed inventories**: Equipment from different programs or departments gets intermingled.
- **Room-to-room movement**: Assets shift between locations without anyone updating records.

Location tracking solves these problems by making every movement visible and every update fast.

## How Shelf Tracks Locations

### Manual or QR-Based Updates

Update an asset's location with a quick scan or a few taps. When equipment moves, staff can log the new location in seconds—no forms, no delays.

---

### Hierarchical Locations

Organize locations into logical structures: buildings, floors, rooms, storage areas, vehicles, and job sites. Shelf supports nested hierarchies that match how your organization actually works.

---

### Integrated with Custody

Location and custody work together:

- **Location** = where the item is
- **Custody** = who has it

Both update independently, giving you complete visibility into an asset's status.

See: [Custody](/features/custody)

---

### Visibility Across Workspaces

Track locations across departments, programs, or sites using workspaces. Each team manages its own inventory while administrators see the full picture.

See: [Workspaces](/features/workspaces)
