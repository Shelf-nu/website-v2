# Signed Custody

When high-value or regulated equipment changes hands, a simple custody log is not always enough. Signed custody adds a layer of formal accountability by requiring a digital signature at the moment of transfer. The result is a tamper-proof record that proves who accepted responsibility, when, and under what terms.

## Why Signature Collection Matters

Not every asset needs a signature on transfer — but some absolutely do:

- **Liability protection**: When expensive equipment is damaged or lost, organizations need documentation showing that the recipient acknowledged responsibility. Without a signature, disputes are difficult to resolve.
- **Regulatory compliance**: Industries such as healthcare, education, and government often require documented proof of custody transfers for audits and inspections.
- **High-value equipment**: Cameras, medical devices, construction machinery, and IT infrastructure represent significant investments. A signed record reduces the risk of careless handling.
- **Insurance requirements**: Many insurance policies require documented chain-of-custody records to process claims for lost or damaged assets.

## How Signed Custody Works in Shelf

### Upload PDF Agreement Templates

Create or upload a PDF custody agreement that reflects your organization's terms. This document can include liability language, return expectations, care instructions, or any other conditions relevant to the transfer.

---

### Require Signature on Custody Transfer

When a custody transfer is initiated for a signed-custody asset, the recipient is prompted to review the agreement and provide a digital signature before the handoff completes. The transfer does not proceed until the signature is captured.

---

### Automatic Notifications

Both the sender and recipient receive notifications when a signed custody transfer is initiated, completed, or pending. Managers can also be notified, ensuring oversight without manual follow-up.

---

### Complete Audit Trail

Every signed transfer is logged with the signer's identity, timestamp, and a copy of the signed agreement. This audit trail is accessible from the asset's detail page and can be exported for compliance reporting.
