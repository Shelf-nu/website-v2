# Asset Search

Finding the right asset should take seconds, not minutes. Shelf's search works across every field in your database — name, custodian, category, status, location, tags, and any custom field you have defined. Start typing and results appear instantly, regardless of how large your inventory is.

---

## Why Search Matters for Asset Management

As inventories grow, finding a specific item becomes the bottleneck. Spreadsheets require manual scrolling or fragile filter combinations. Paper logs offer no search capability at all. Even basic asset tools often limit search to a single field like name or ID.

When teams cannot find assets quickly, they waste time, create duplicate records, or check out items that are already reserved. Fast, comprehensive search eliminates these problems by giving every user immediate access to any record in the system.

## How Search Works in Shelf

### Multi-Field Search

Shelf searches across all fields simultaneously. Type a custodian name, a serial number, a category label, or a custom field value — the search engine queries everything at once and returns matching results ranked by relevance.

---

### Custom Field Support

If your organization tracks assets with custom fields — such as warranty expiration, purchase order number, or condition rating — those fields are fully searchable. There is no distinction between built-in fields and custom ones when it comes to finding what you need.

---

### Instant Results

Search results appear as you type. There is no need to press enter and wait for a page reload. This makes search practical for high-volume environments where staff check availability dozens of times per day.

---

### Works at Any Scale

Whether your database contains 50 assets or 50,000, search performance stays consistent. Shelf is designed for growing inventories, so adding more records does not degrade the experience.
