# Workspaces

As organizations grow, so does the complexity of managing equipment. Different teams need access to different inventories, workflows, and permissions — without stepping on each other’s toes.

Workspaces in Shelf let you organize assets, people, and processes cleanly across departments or client groups.

---

## Why Workspaces Matter

Workspaces are powerful for:

- universities with separate Film, AV, Science, or Engineering departments  
- production companies serving multiple clients  
- IT departments organizing device programs  
- operations teams managing field crews by region  
- internal teams with specialized inventories  

Workspaces eliminate the clutter and confusion of one giant shared equipment pool.

## How Workspaces Help Teams Stay Organized

### Separate Inventories
Each workspace has its own:

- assets  
- categories  
- kits  
- bookings  
- reports  

No accidental cross-team mixing.

### Independent Permissions
Give users access only to the workspaces they need.

### Cleaner Workflows
Each team sees only the information relevant to them.

### Perfect for Schools & Studios
Departments stay autonomous while leadership has full visibility.

---

## Example Workspaces Setup

A typical university might create:

- **Film Department** — cameras, lighting, audio  
- **AV Department** — projectors, adapters, carts  
- **Science Labs** — lab kits, microscopes, tools  

A production company might create:

- **Client A** workspace  
- **Client B** workspace  

Each workspace can operate independently while staying under one organization.

## Key Benefits

### Less Confusion
Teams never see irrelevant items or categories.

### Stronger Security
Users get access only where needed.

### Better Reporting
Cleaner data, more accurate insights.

### Flexible Growth
Add more workspaces as programs or clients expand.
