# Workspaces

Workspaces let you organize assets and permissions across departments or teams—giving each group control over their own inventory while keeping administrators in sync.

## Why Workspaces Matter

Organizations with multiple teams or departments face common challenges:

- **Departmental silos**: Each group tracks equipment separately with no shared visibility.
- **Mixed inventories**: Assets from different programs get intermingled and confused.
- **Unclear permissions**: It's hard to control who can access, book, or manage specific equipment.
- **Need for autonomy**: Departments want to manage their own workflows without waiting on central IT.

Workspaces solve these problems by creating clear boundaries—while maintaining the oversight organizations need.

## How Workspaces Work in Shelf

### Separate Inventories

Each workspace has its own assets, users, and configurations. A film department's cameras stay separate from IT's laptops, even within the same organization.

---

### Role & Permission Controls

Assign users to specific workspaces with appropriate permissions. Team members can manage their own equipment without accessing other departments' inventories.

---

### Admin Oversight

Administrators see across all workspaces. Monitor activity, review reports, and ensure consistency organization-wide—without managing every detail.

---

### Cross-Workspace Reporting

Generate reports that span multiple workspaces or focus on individual teams. Get the visibility you need at any level.
