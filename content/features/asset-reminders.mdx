# Asset Reminders

Shared equipment relies on predictable behavior: users must return items on time, and staff need to know when gear requires inspection or maintenance. Without reminders, items go missing, maintenance gets skipped, and operations slow down.

Shelf automates reminders for returns, inspections, and maintenance — keeping everything moving smoothly.

---

## Why Asset Reminders Matter

Reminders are essential when:

- students forget return times  
- teams use shared tools across locations  
- IT devices require periodic inspection  
- AV gear needs regular checks  
- maintenance cycles must be tracked  
- overdue items disrupt availability  

Shelf reduces manual chasing and improves reliability.

## What Asset Reminders Can Do

### Return Reminders
Notify users before equipment is due, reducing late returns.

### Overdue Alerts
Automatically surface overdue items so staff can act quickly.

### Inspection Reminders
Great for:

- AV gear check-ins  
- safety equipment  
- classroom resources  
- field tools  
- lab equipment  

### Maintenance Cycles
Set reminders for:

- calibration  
- cleaning  
- part replacements  
- safety inspections  

### Integrated With Bookings & Custody
Reminders follow real workflow events — not static rules.

---

## Workflow Example

1. Student books a camera kit.  
2. Shelf reminds them before the due time.  
3. If overdue → users receive notifications, and staff see flags.  
4. When returned → staff perform inspection tasks.  
5. Maintenance reminders surface based on cycles or usage.  

Shelf handles the logistics so teams can focus on people and projects.
