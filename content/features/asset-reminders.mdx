# Asset Reminders

Asset reminders keep teams proactive with automated notifications for returns, inspections, maintenance, and any time-sensitive equipment events.

## What Reminders Solve

Without automated reminders, teams struggle with:

- **Overdue equipment**: Items stay checked out longer than expected with no follow-up.
- **Forgotten inspections**: Safety checks and certifications slip past their due dates.
- **Missing return dates**: Staff forget when items need to come back.
- **Manual follow-up**: Managers spend time chasing people instead of managing operations.
- **Compliance issues**: Missed maintenance windows create safety and regulatory risks.

Reminders solve these problems by surfacing what needs attention—before it becomes a problem.

## How Reminders Work in Shelf

### Automated Notifications

Set time-based reminders for any asset event. Shelf sends notifications when dates approach, keeping teams informed without manual tracking.

---

### Linked to Bookings

Reminders integrate with bookings to notify users when returns are due. If equipment is overdue, the system flags it automatically.

See: [Bookings](/features/bookings)

---

### Maintenance Scheduling

Schedule recurring reminders for inspections, calibrations, cleaning, and service cycles. Shelf surfaces upcoming and overdue maintenance so nothing slips through the cracks.
