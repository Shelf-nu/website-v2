# Custody

When equipment is shared across students, staff, teams, or field crews, accountability becomes critical. Without a system for tracking **who has what**, items go missing, kits become incomplete, and teams waste time searching.

Custody in Shelf creates a clear, auditable history of responsibility for every asset — with just one action.

---

## Why Custody Matters

Custody is essential when:

- equipment is checked out or borrowed  
- tools move across sites or trucks  
- devices change hands during onboarding/offboarding  
- students use cameras, lab tools, or AV gear  
- teams need a clear audit trail  

Shelf makes custody simple, fast, and reliable.

## How Custody Works in Shelf

### One-Tap Assignment
Scan an asset’s QR label → assign custody instantly.

### Automated History
Every custody change is logged automatically.

### Person or Location-Based Custody
Assign assets to:

- individuals  
- teams  
- rooms  
- trucks  
- studios  
- departments  

### Complete Audit Trail
See who had the item, when they had it, and where it traveled.

### Integrated With Returns
Returning an item automatically closes the custody loop.

---

## Workflow Example

1. User scans a QR label.  
2. Shelf assigns custody based on the workflow (check-out, booking, handoff).  
3. During use, custody changes track movement across people or places.  
4. User returns the item → custody is cleared.  
5. History becomes part of the asset record.  

This works across education, IT, field operations, AV departments, and more.
