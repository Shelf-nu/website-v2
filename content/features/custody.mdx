# Custody

Custody tracking ensures you always know who is responsible for each asset. Shelf logs every handover automatically, creating a complete accountability trail from check-out to return. [See how Eastern Michigan University uses this at scale](/case-studies/eastern-michigan-university).

## Why Custody Matters

Without clear custody tracking, organizations face recurring problems:

- **Responsibility gaps**: When equipment changes hands, no one knows who's accountable.
- **Unclear handovers**: Transfers happen informally, leaving no record.
- **Lost gear**: Items disappear and no one can trace the last responsible person.
- **Compliance issues**: Audits require proof of who had what—and when.
- **Incidents without history**: When something breaks or goes missing, there's no trail to review.

Custody tracking solves these problems by logging responsibility at every step—automatically.

## How Shelf Handles Custody

### Instant QR Transfers

Scan a QR code to transfer custody in seconds. No paperwork, no delays. The responsible person updates immediately, and the system logs the transaction.

---

### Automatic Assignment from Bookings

When a reservation begins, custody transfers automatically. When equipment is returned, the system updates instantly. Booking and custody work together in one unified workflow.

See: [Bookings](/features/bookings)

---

### Full Accountability Trail

Every asset has a timeline showing who had it and when. Review custody history at any time—for audits, incident investigation, or operational oversight.

---

### Departmental Control with Workspaces

Separate custody tracking by department, location, or team. Each workspace manages its own accountability while administrators retain visibility across the organization.
