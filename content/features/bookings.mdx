# Bookings

Bookings let teams reserve equipment ahead of time with conflict-free scheduling. Whether you're managing cameras, laptops, tools, or shared resources, Shelf ensures availability is clear and coordination is seamless.

## What Bookings Solve

Shared equipment creates coordination challenges:

- **Double bookings**: Multiple people reserve the same item for the same time without realizing it.
- **Unclear availability**: No one knows what's free, what's out, or when it's coming back.
- **Manual calendars**: Spreadsheets and paper logs drift out of sync and fail under pressure.
- **Resource conflicts**: Teams compete for the same gear, leading to delays and frustration.
- **Poor coordination across departments**: Different groups operate in silos without shared visibility.

Shelf's booking system solves these problems with real-time availability, automatic conflict prevention, and unified workflows that connect scheduling to actual handoffs.

## How Bookings Work in Shelf

### Real-Time Availability

The availability view shows exactly when each item is free. Users see open time slots at a glance—no guessing, no calling the equipment room, no spreadsheet lookups.

---

### Simple Reservation Workflow

Booking takes seconds:

1. Choose the item you need
2. Select an available time slot
3. Confirm the reservation

That's it. The system handles the rest.

### Automatic Conflict Prevention

Shelf validates every booking in real time. If a time slot is taken, users simply can't book it. Conflicts are prevented before they happen—not discovered on the morning of a shoot. [Fabel Film eliminated double bookings with Shelf](/case-studies/fabel-film-double-bookings).

### Unified with Custody

Bookings and custody work together. When a reservation starts, custody transfers automatically. When equipment is returned, the system updates instantly. Scheduling and responsibility live in the same workflow.

### Kit-Aware Reservations

Users can reserve individual items or entire kits. Book a camera kit, and all its accessories come along. Shelf tracks what belongs together and keeps kits complete.
