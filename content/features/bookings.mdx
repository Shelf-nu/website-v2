# Bookings

When teams share equipment, scheduling becomes one of the biggest sources of friction. People need tools, cameras, kits, or devices at the same time, and without a proper system, conflicts happen — delaying projects and frustrating students or staff.

Shelf provides a clean, modern booking experience that prevents conflicts and keeps equipment available exactly when teams need it.

---

## Why Bookings Matter

Bookings are essential when:

- multiple users share limited gear  
- students reserve AV or camera equipment for class projects  
- labs schedule tools or field kits  
- departments coordinate equipment between classes or shoots  
- production teams need predictable access to kits  

Without reliable bookings, operations become chaotic.

## How Bookings Work in Shelf

### Conflict-Free Scheduling
Shelf prevents overlapping reservations automatically.

### Clear Time Windows
Users see exactly when an item is available or booked.

### Fast, Frictionless Booking Flow
Book directly from:

- search  
- availability view  
- the asset page  
- kits  

### Integrated With Check-Outs
Bookings automatically transition into custody assignments.

### Supports Single Items or Kits
Perfect for complex AV and camera setups.

### Reminders & Return Notifications
Ensure users return items on time.

---

## Workflow Example

A typical booking workflow:

1. User searches for a camera or tool.  
2. Shelf shows availability.  
3. User selects a time window and books.  
4. Staff prepare the kit (or auto-approve).  
5. User arrives → custody assigned.  
6. After the loan period, reminders help ensure timely return.  

This flow keeps equipment moving with minimal overhead.
