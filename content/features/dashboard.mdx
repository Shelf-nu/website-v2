# Dashboard

Managing equipment at scale requires visibility: what’s booked, what’s overdue, what needs maintenance, and what’s moving between teams or locations.

Shelf’s Dashboard gives teams a clean, real-time overview of their operations so they can stay ahead of issues instead of reacting to them.

---

## Why the Dashboard Matters

The Dashboard is essential for:

- gear rooms preparing for busy periods  
- AV/Film departments managing student demand  
- IT teams monitoring device loans  
- field teams coordinating tool usage  
- administrators reviewing accountability  

It reduces uncertainty and increases confidence in operations.
