# Dashboard

The dashboard gives teams a real-time view of bookings, custody, overdue items, and asset activity—providing clarity at a glance.

---

## What the Dashboard Shows

The dashboard surfaces the operational data that matters most:

- **Bookings**: Upcoming reservations, active check-outs, and scheduled returns.
- **Overdue items**: Equipment that hasn't been returned on time.
- **Custody changes**: Recent handovers and responsibility transfers.
- **Usage trends**: Activity patterns that help inform planning and resource allocation.

Everything updates in real time, so you're always working with current information.

## How the Dashboard Helps Teams

### Central Visibility

One screen shows booking activity, custody status, and overdue items across your organization. No need to check multiple systems or ask around.

---

### Faster Decisions

With real-time data, managers can make quick decisions: reassign equipment, follow up on overdue items, or adjust schedules on the fly.

---

### Early Problem Detection

The dashboard surfaces issues before they escalate. Overdue equipment, booking conflicts, and unusual activity patterns become visible immediately.

---

### Department-Level Insights (Workspaces)

Filter the dashboard by workspace to see data for specific departments, locations, or teams. Each workspace can focus on its own operations while administrators retain the full picture.
