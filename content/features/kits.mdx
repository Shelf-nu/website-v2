# Kits

Kits let you group equipment with its accessories so everything stays together—cameras with lenses, tools with components, and devices with chargers.

## Why Kits Matter

Accessories are the most commonly lost items in any equipment operation:

- **Missing accessories**: Chargers, cables, batteries, and adapters disappear without anyone noticing.
- **Mismatched sets**: Components end up with the wrong parent items, creating confusion.
- **Confusion during check-in**: Staff can't tell what's missing when items return incomplete.
- **Manual checking slows operations**: Verifying every component by hand creates bottlenecks.

Kits solve these problems by defining what belongs together—and automatically tracking completeness.

## How Kits Work in Shelf

### Parent + Child Items

A kit consists of a parent item (like a camera) and its child items (lenses, batteries, cables, cases). Shelf knows what belongs together and tracks each component.

### Kit-Aware Bookings

When users book a kit, all its accessories come along. No need to reserve each item separately—the entire bundle is scheduled as one unit.

### Missing Item Detection

During check-in, Shelf compares what's returned against what should be in the kit. If something is missing, the system flags it immediately—no manual counting required.

---

### Custody & Location Sync

Kit items inherit updates from the parent. When custody or location changes for the kit, all child items update automatically.
