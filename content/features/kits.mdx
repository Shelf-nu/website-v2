# Kits

Some equipment is only useful as a set: a camera body with lenses, audio equipment with cables, lab instruments bundled with tools, or IT devices packaged with chargers.

Shelf makes kits a first-class part of your workflow, helping teams check out complete setups and ensure every accessory returns safely.

## Why Kits Matter

Many industries rely on kit-based workflows:

- film & media programs  
- AV departments  
- production companies  
- engineering labs  
- IT device bundles  
- field tool bags  

Without kits, teams end up:

- tracking items separately  
- losing accessories  
- issuing incomplete sets  
- spending time verifying items manually  

Shelf solves this by making kits simple, trackable, and integrated into every workflow.

## How Kits Work in Shelf

### Build Flexible Kits
Combine:

- cameras + lenses  
- lights + stands  
- audio recorders + cables  
- lab equipment + tools  
- dummy devices + chargers  

### Check Out Everything at Once
Users borrow a full kit with a single action.

### Integrated With Custody
When a kit is assigned, each asset in it has custody tracked independently.

### Works With Bookings
Kits can be scheduled just like individual items.

### Return Verification
Shelf highlights:

- missing parts  
- swapped accessories  
- incomplete returns  

### Great for Teaching & Production
Students and staff always get everything they need — no surprises.

---

## Workflow Example

1. Staff prepare a camera kit with all accessories.  
2. Student books the kit for a class or production.  
3. User arrives → scan → entire kit is checked out.  
4. Shelf tracks custody of each item inside the kit.  
5. When returned → Shelf flags missing items or mismatched accessories.  
6. Kit becomes available for the next user.  

This dramatically reduces loss and frustration.
