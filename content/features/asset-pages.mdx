# Asset Pages

Every asset in Shelf gets its own dedicated page — a single source of truth that brings together everything you need to know about an item. Photos, custom fields, custody history, location, availability status, notes, and a printable QR label all live in one place. No more switching between spreadsheets, email threads, and shared drives to piece together asset information.

## Why Asset Pages Beat Spreadsheets

Spreadsheets are where asset data goes to decay. Teams that manage equipment in spreadsheets encounter the same problems:

- **Coordination issues**: Multiple people editing the same file leads to overwritten data and version conflicts.
- **Unreliable data**: Fields go stale because updating a spreadsheet feels like a chore. No one knows if the information is current.
- **No context**: A spreadsheet row cannot hold a photo, a custody timeline, a location history, and a QR code. Critical context lives somewhere else — or nowhere at all.
- **No access control**: Everyone sees everything, or the sheet is locked down so tightly that no one can update it.

Asset pages solve these problems by giving each item a structured, always-current profile that the right people can view and update from any device.

## What's on an Asset Page

### Photos

Upload multiple photos to document the asset's appearance, condition, serial number labels, or installation context. Visual documentation reduces confusion and supports insurance and compliance needs.

---

### Custom Fields

Define any fields your organization requires — purchase date, warranty expiration, condition rating, vendor, cost center, or anything else. Custom fields appear on the asset page alongside built-in fields, fully searchable and filterable.

---

### Custody History

See the complete timeline of who has had the asset and when. Every check-out, return, and transfer is logged automatically with timestamps and user identities.

See: [Custody](/features/custody)

---

### Location

View the asset's current location and its location history. When someone scans the QR label, the location updates automatically. Managers always know where equipment is — or where it was last seen.

See: [Location Tracking](/features/location-tracking)

---

### Availability Status

The asset page shows whether the item is available, checked out, reserved, or in maintenance. This status updates in real time as bookings and custody events occur.

---

### Notes

Add free-text notes to capture anything that does not fit a structured field — maintenance observations, usage tips, or special handling instructions. Notes are timestamped and visible to everyone with access.

---

### QR Label

Every asset page includes a printable QR code that links directly to that page. Scan the label with any phone to pull up the full asset profile instantly. No app installation required.

---

## Display Modes

- **Full view**: Shows every field, photo, custody timeline, and note in a single scrollable page. Ideal for detailed review and asset management.
- **Compact view**: A condensed layout that highlights key information — name, status, custodian, and location — for quick reference in list contexts.

---

## Common Use Cases

- **Conference rooms and AV gear**: Each projector, screen, and microphone has a profile with setup notes, location, and booking status.
- **Vehicles**: Fleet assets carry maintenance history, mileage logs, insurance details, and assignment records on a single page.
- **Lab equipment**: Instruments display calibration dates, safety instructions, and custody chains for compliance.
- **Tools and field equipment**: Condition photos, warranty information, and location history help field managers track distributed assets.
