# Calendar

The calendar gives teams a visual overview of every reservation, custody event, and availability gap across their entire inventory. Instead of digging through lists or asking colleagues, anyone can open the calendar and see exactly what is booked, what is available, and what is overdue.

---

## What the Calendar Solves

Scheduling shared equipment without a visual timeline creates recurring problems:

- **Scheduling conflicts**: Teams unknowingly book the same asset for overlapping time slots because no one has a clear picture of what is already reserved.
- **Lack of visibility**: Managers cannot see at a glance which items are in use, which are sitting idle, and which are overdue for return.
- **Coordination gaps**: Departments working in silos create bottlenecks when they compete for the same pool of resources without a shared view.
- **Missed returns**: Without a visual indicator of overdue items, late returns go unnoticed until someone else needs the equipment.

Shelf's calendar view solves each of these by putting availability, reservations, and status into a single visual timeline that the whole team can access.

## How the Calendar Works in Shelf

### Month, Week, and Day Views

Switch between month, week, and day views depending on the level of detail you need. The month view works well for long-range planning. The week and day views are ideal for daily coordination and last-minute scheduling.

---

### Color-Coded Status

Each booking is color-coded to reflect its current status -- reserved, checked out, available, or overdue. Users can scan the calendar and immediately understand the state of every asset without reading individual records.

---

### Overdue Highlighting

Items that have not been returned by their scheduled end time are highlighted automatically. Equipment managers can spot overdue assets in seconds and follow up before the delay cascades into the next reservation.

---

### Integrated with Bookings and Custody

The calendar is not a standalone feature. It draws directly from the bookings and custody systems, so every reservation and handoff appears in real time. When a booking is created or a custody transfer happens, the calendar updates instantly.

## Common Use Cases

- **AV equipment rooms**: Coordinators see which cameras, projectors, and microphones are booked across the week and plan around availability.
- **Shared vehicles**: Fleet managers view vehicle reservations across the month and redistribute demand across the pool.
- **Lab equipment**: Researchers check the calendar before scheduling experiments to confirm instrument availability.
- **Construction tools**: Site managers coordinate tool assignments across crews and job sites using the day and week views.
