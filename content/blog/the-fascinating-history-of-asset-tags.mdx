In this article, we'll explore the history of asset tags and how they have evolved over time.

## Origins of Asset Management

The concept of asset management dates back to the early 20th century when businesses began to track their inventory using manual systems, such as card catalogs and ledger books. These systems were time-consuming and prone to errors, making it difficult to maintain accurate records of assets.

In the 1970s, the advent of computers and database technology revolutionized the way businesses managed their assets. Companies began to use asset management software to track their assets electronically, which allowed them to easily update and retrieve asset information.

> Did you know? Some of the earliest examples of asset management software include IBM's FAMIS (Facilities Asset Management Information System) and EAM (Enterprise Asset Management), which were developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s. These software systems were primarily used by large corporations and government agencies to manage their physical assets, such as buildings, vehicles, and equipment.

## The Rise of Asset Tags

As [asset management software](https://www.shelf.nu/blog/benefits-of-asset-management-software) became more sophisticated, businesses realized the need for a way to quickly and accurately identify their physical assets. In the late 1970s, the first asset tags were introduced, consisting of simple metal or plastic tags with engraved numbers.

As technology continued to advance, asset tags evolved to include barcodes and [QR codes](https://www.shelf.nu/blog/qr-code-asset-tagging-revolutionizing-asset-management-and-tracking), which could be easily scanned using handheld barcode scanners. This allowed businesses to quickly and accurately track their assets, reducing the risk of loss or theft.
