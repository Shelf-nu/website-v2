## OSS Capital x Shelf

I am thrilled to announce that Shelf, our innovative software startup in the realm of [asset management](https://www.shelf.nu/blog/how-to-choose-the-best-asset-tags-for-your-equipment), has recently secured a strategic investment from [OSS Capital](https://oss.capital), a venture capital firm renowned for its support of open-source projects. This partnership marks a momentous milestone for both Shelf and OSS Capital as we unite our efforts to position Shelf as the premier asset management solution for teams and businesses.

Shelf, co-founded by Carlos Virreira and Nikolay Bonev, has been built upon the open-source model and aspires to become an indispensable application-level tool within the realm of asset management systems. Backed by a robust network of open-source contributors, Shelf is primed to disrupt the industry through its innovative asset management approach.

OSS Capital, through their GitRound platform, has acquired a 2.5% stake in Shelf. This investment underscores their unwavering belief in Shelf's potential. These funds will empower us to further develop our project, refine our licensing, and enhance our overall value proposition.

Our ultimate aspiration at Shelf is to empower teams and businesses worldwide to track one billion assets utilizing our tool. With the support of OSS Capital, we intend to leverage this investment, access valuable networking opportunities, and receive expert coaching to achieve this audacious target.

> "We couldn't have asked for a better investment partner for Shelf than OSS Capital. Joseph Jacks and his team truly understand open-source software at its core, and their commitment to accelerating open-source development while delivering exceptional user value perfectly aligns with our vision. We eagerly anticipate the forthcoming months and greatly appreciate the support that enables us to continue crafting exceptional software for this vital use case."- Carlos Virreira

The collaboration between [Shelf](https://github.com/Shelf-nu/shelf.nu) and OSS Capital signifies a substantial stride forward for both entities. By pooling our strengths, we aim to create a game-changing asset management solution that caters to the evolving needs of modern teams and businesses. Our shared dedication to open-source principles and user-centric approaches assures that this partnership will yield groundbreaking results in the years ahead.

Thank you for your dedication and contributions to Shelf's journey. Together, we are poised for remarkable success.

Best regards,
