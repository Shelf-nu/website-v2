> The Birth of Fablab: A Brief History

> The concept of Fablab was pioneered by Dr. Neil Gershenfeld in the early 2000s. The first Fablab, called the "Center for Bits and Atoms Fab Lab," was established at MIT in 2003. This groundbreaking initiative aimed to democratize access to advanced manufacturing tools, such as 3D printers and laser cutters, empowering individuals from various backgrounds to turn their ideas into reality. Dr. Gershenfeld's vision paved the way for a global network of Fablabs, fostering innovation and creativity worldwide. Today, efficient equipment management, like that offered by Shelf.nu, supports Fablabs in their mission to enable creativity and innovation on a global scale.
