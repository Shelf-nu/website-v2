## **A Decision Framework for Choosing the Best Asset Tags for Your Equipment**

To choose the best asset tags for your equipment, you need to consider two main factors: the **material** of the **equipment**and the **usage** of the equipment.

The material of the equipment refers to what your equipment is made of and how it affects the adhesion and visibility of the asset tags. For example, if your equipment is made of metal or plastic, you need asset tags that have a strong adhesive and a contrasting color. If your equipment is made of wood or fabric, you need asset tags that are flexible and water-resistant.

The usage of the equipment refers to how often and where your equipment is used and how it affects the durability and security of the asset tags. For example, if your equipment is used indoors and infrequently, you can use low-cost and low-durability asset tags such as paper or vinyl. 

If your equipment is used outdoors and frequently, you need high-cost and high-durability asset tags such as polyester or aluminum.

Based on these two factors, you can use the following decision framework to choose the best asset tags for your equipment:

- If your equipment is made of metal or plastic and used indoors and infrequently , choose **vinyl** asset tags.
- If your equipment is made of metal or plastic and used indoors and frequently , choose **polyester** asset tags.
- If your equipment is made of metal or plastic and used outdoors and infrequently , choose **aluminum foil** asset tags.
- If your equipment is made of metal or plastic and used outdoors and frequently , choose **anodized aluminum** asset tags.
- If your equipment is made of wood or fabric and used indoors and infrequently , choose **paper** asset tags.
- If your equipment is made of wood or fabric and used indoors and frequently , choose **vinyl** asset tags.
- If your equipment is made of wood or fabric and used outdoors and infrequently , choose **polyester** asset tags.
- If your equipment is made of wood or fabric and used outdoors and frequently , choose **aluminum foil** or **anodized aluminum** asset tags.

## **Asset Tags by Industry**

Different industries have different needs and challenges when it comes to asset tagging. Here are some examples of how asset tags can be used and what factors to consider for five common industries:

- **Education**: Schools, colleges, and universities use asset tags to track and manage their educational equipment, such as laptops, tablets, projectors, cameras, books, and furniture. Asset tags can help them prevent theft, loss, and damage of valuable assets, as well as monitor their usage and maintenance. Asset tags for education should be durable, tamper-evident, and easy to scan. They should also include information such as the name of the institution, the department, the asset number, and the barcode or [QR code](https://www.shelf.nu/blog/all-you-need-to-know-about-qr-codes). A good option for asset tags for education is **polyester** labels with tamper-evident or destructible features.
- **Healthcare**: Hospitals, clinics, and laboratories use asset tags to track and manage their medical equipment, such as scanners, monitors, pumps, beds, and instruments. Asset tags can help them improve patient safety, quality of care, and operational efficiency. Asset tags for healthcare should be durable, chemical-resistant, easy to clean, and compliant with health regulations. They should also include information such as the name of the facility, the asset number, the barcode or QR code, and the expiration date if applicable. A good option for asset tags for healthcare is **anodized aluminum** labels with embedded print and high-bond adhesive.
- **Manufacturing**: Factories, warehouses, and workshops use asset tags to track and manage their [industrial equipment](https://www.shelf.nu/industries/automotive-manufacturing), such as machines, tools, vehicles, and inventory. Asset tags can help them optimize production, reduce downtime, and prevent accidents. Asset tags for manufacturing should be durable, abrasion-resistant, weather-resistant, and conformable. They should also include information such as the name of the company, the asset number, the barcode or QR code, and the maintenance schedule if applicable. A good option for asset tags for manufacturing is **aluminum foil** labels with metalized print and aggressive adhesive.
- **Retail**: Stores, malls, and supermarkets use asset tags to track and manage their retail equipment, such as cash registers, scanners, shelves, carts, and products. Asset tags can help them improve inventory control, customer service, and sales performance. Asset tags for retail should be durable, water-resistant, glossy, and attractive. They should also include information such as the name of the store, the product name, the price, the barcode or QR code, and the security feature if applicable. A good option for asset tags for retail is **polyester** labels with glossy finish and tamper-evident or destructible features.
- **IT**: Offices, data centers, and software companies use asset tags to track and manage their IT equipment, such as computers, laptops, servers, routers, and cables. Asset tags can help them secure their data, enhance their performance, and troubleshoot their issues. Asset tags for IT should be durable, laminated, easy to read, and compatible with scanners. They should also include information such as the name of the company, the asset number, the barcode or QR code, and the serial number if applicable. A good option for asset tags for IT is **anodized aluminum** labels with embedded print and high-bond adhesive.

## **Conclusion**

Asset tags are essential for tracking and managing your equipment in different industries. However, not all asset tags are created equal. You need to choose the best asset tags for your equipment based on the material and usage of your equipment. By using the table and the decision framework above, you can find the best asset tags for your equipment that are durable, reliable, and cost-effective.
