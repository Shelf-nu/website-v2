## Small improvement to Bookings Area

At Shelf, we're always striving to make your equipment management experience more seamless and efficient. Today, we're excited to announce a couple of improvements to our bookings feature that will save you time and simplify your workflow.

First up, we've added an "*Add to Calendar*" button to the booking page for past bookings. This generates an ICS (Internet Calendar Subscription) file containing essential information about the booking, along with a link to the booking page. Now, you can easily add your bookings to your preferred calendar app or platform, keeping track of your schedule a breeze.

Take a look at how it works:

*After a booking has crossed a 'draft' status, you can see an 'add to calendar' button on the page*

## Further adjustments to bookings

Next, we've refined the starting time default setting for quick bookings. We understand that sometimes you need to reserve equipment quickly, without having to worry about adjusting dates and times. With this update, when you select a start time, we'll automatically set it to the current date and time, plus 10 minutes. All you need to do is enter an end time, assign a custodian, and add assets before clicking "Reserve." It's that simple!

And don't forget, the generated calendar file can be shared with others, allowing them to easily add the booking to their calendars as well.

These changes aim to streamline your booking experience, saving you valuable time and effort while ensuring you stay organized and on top of your equipment reservations. As always, we're committed to continually improving Shelf to meet your needs and enhance your user experience.

Stay tuned for more exciting updates and features coming soon!
