title: Introducing Custom Field Linking to Categories
description: >-
  In asset management, not all fields are relevant for every category. For
  instance, a laptop has a MAC address, but a chair does not. This can lead to
  cluttered and inefficient asset tracking, making it difficult to find the
  information you need quickly. Our users have been asking for a way to tailor
  their custom fields to specific categories, and we're happy to deliver.
