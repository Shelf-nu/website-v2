# **What are Digital Twins and how can you use them for your business?**

Digital twins are one of the most exciting and promising [technologies](https://www.shelf.nu/blog-categories/qr-code-technology) in the era of digital transformation. They can help you optimize your products, processes, and systems, as well as unlock new opportunities for innovation and growth. But what exactly are [digital twins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin) and how can you use them for your business?

## **What is a digital twin?**

*A digital representation of a physical asset can be considered a twin*

A digital twin is a virtual representation of an object or system that spans its lifecycle, is updated from real-time data, and uses simulation, machine learning and reasoning to help decision-making[1](https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-a-digital-twin). A digital twin can be created for any physical entity, such as a product, a process, a machine, a building, a city, or even a human body.

A digital twin is not just a static model or a simulation. It is a dynamic and interactive environment that mirrors the physical counterpart in every aspect. It can capture the structure, behavior, performance, and context of the physical entity, as well as its interactions with other entities and the environment. It can also run various scenarios and experiments to test and improve the physical entity’s outcomes.

A digital twin is connected to the physical entity through sensors and communication channels that enable a two-way flow of information. The sensors collect data from the physical entity and send it to the digital twin, where it is processed and analyzed. The digital twin then generates insights and recommendations that are sent back to the physical entity or to other stakeholders. This feedback loop allows the digital twin to learn from the physical entity and vice versa.

## **Types of digital twins**

There are various types of digital twins depending on the level of product magnification. The biggest difference between these twins is the area of application. It is common to have different types of digital twins co-exist within a system or process2. Let’s go through the types of digital twins to learn the differences and how they are applied.

### **Component twins/Parts twins**

Component twins are the basic unit of the digital twin, the smallest example of a functioning component. Parts twins are roughly the same thing, but pertain to components of slightly less importance. For example, a component twin could be a sensor or an actuator in a machine, while a parts twin could be a screw or a nut. Component twins and parts twins can help monitor the health and performance of individual components and parts, as well as detect faults and anomalies.

### **Asset twins**

When two or more components work together, they form what is known as an asset. Asset twins let you study the interaction of those components, creating a wealth of performance data that can be processed and then turned into actionable insights[1](https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-a-digital-twin). For example, an asset twin could be a wind turbine or an engine that consists of multiple components and parts. Asset twins can help optimize the operation and maintenance of assets, as well as improve their design and engineering.

### **System twins**

When two or more assets work together, they form what is known as a system. System twins let you study the interaction of those assets, creating a holistic view of the system’s functionality and efficiency2. For example, a system twin could be a power plant or a factory that consists of multiple assets and processes. System twins can help coordinate and integrate the activities of different assets and processes, as well as enhance their productivity and quality.

### **Process twins**

When two or more systems work together, they form what is known as a process. Process twins let you study the interaction of those systems, creating a comprehensive understanding of the process’s outcomes and impacts2. For example, a process twin could be an energy grid or a supply chain that consists of multiple systems and stakeholders. Process twins can help optimize and innovate the process’s operations and strategies, as well as measure and improve its performance and sustainability.

To illustrate how digital twins can be used for your business, let’s look at some examples of digital twin applications and use cases across different industries.

### **Aerospace**

Aerospace tasks are intrinsically complex. End products like aircraft and spacecraft are massively expensive to design and build, making it all the more imperative to get work done right the first time in order to avoid costly delays. From design and engineering all the way through to assembly and maintenance, digital twins improve decision-making by allowing teams to visualize and interact with computer-aided design (CAD) models and other datasets in real-time 3D[1](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/tip/Use-cases-of-digital-twins-for-networks).

Some of the use cases of digital twins in aerospace are:

- Product development and prototyping: 3D visualization enables designers, engineers and other stakeholders to better collaborate and evaluate design and manufacturing alternatives for complex systems.
- Simulation and training: Engaging training experiences in interactive 3D or augmented or virtual reality (AR and VR) enable better knowledge transfer and safer workplaces.
- Maintenance and operations: Creating work instructions in mixed reality from as-built models from design and manufacturing can simplify and optimize inspection, maintenance, and repair activities.
- Sales and marketing: Virtual showrooms and 3D product configurators empower buyers to explore every variation of aircraft and make purchasing decisions more confidently.

An example of a company that uses digital twins in aerospace is Boeing. Boeing created an AR-powered aircraft inspection application using a digital twin of one of its planes. [The twin enabled this aerospace industry leader to generate over 100,000 synthetic images to better train the machine learning algorithms of the AR application.](https://softengi.com/blog/use-cases-and-applications-of-digital-twin/)

### **Architecture**

At the start of a project, architects produce design materials, including renderings and models, to allow clients to evaluate and approve the design. The problem is there’s no shared, collaborative environment with stakeholders to make decisions in real-time. Communicating design intent during traditional reviews is a difficult process. Static 2D and 3D models cause details to be lost in translation, renderings aren’t flexible enough, and not everyone is on the same page. Digital twins solve these problems so there’s no more costly mistakes[1](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/tip/Use-cases-of-digital-twins-for-networks).

Some of the use cases of digital twins in architecture are:

- Design review: Architects and designers can easily bring design models into an immersive experience in AR

and VR to facilitate interactive, real-time design reviews. They can also invite clients and other stakeholders to join the immersive experience and provide feedback and approval.

- Construction planning: Architects and contractors can use digital twins to plan and coordinate the construction process, such as scheduling, budgeting, resource allocation, site management, etc. They can also use digital twins to monitor the progress and quality of the construction work and identify and resolve any issues or risks.
- Facility management: Architects and facility managers can use digital twins to optimize the operation and maintenance of buildings, such as energy consumption, indoor environment quality, security, safety, etc. They can also use digital twins to enhance the user experience and satisfaction of the occupants and visitors.

An example of a company that uses digital twins in architecture is Foster + Partners. Foster + Partners is a global studio for architecture, urbanism and design that uses digital twins to create innovative and sustainable solutions for its clients. The company uses Unity’s real-time 3D platform to create digital twins of its projects and enable immersive collaboration and communication with its clients and partners.
