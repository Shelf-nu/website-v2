Attention Shelf Users,

‍

We wanted to inform you that we will be increasing our prices for new subscriptions starting from Q2 2024 (Preparations are taking place now). To continue investing in the development of new features and improvements.

The new pricing structure is as follows:

*Please note that, monthly subscription costs have gone up - yearly remain the same.*

## I am already on a paid plan

If you are currently subscribed to a Shelf plan, **please note that your pricing will remain unchanged**. 

‍

These plans are non-transferable, meaning that if you took advantage of the old prices, you will stay on the same plan and do not need to worry about being switched to the new pricing.

‍

We encourage you to take advantage of the current pricing by upgrading or renewing your*** subscription soon***. This will ensure that you can enjoy the benefits of Shelf at the current rate.

‍

We have opted for increasing the prices of our monthly packages only. Yearly packages remain the same. 
‍

Thank you for choosing Shelf as your equipment management solution. We appreciate your business and look forward to continuing to serve you.
‍

Best regards,  
The Shelf Asset Management, inc - team.
