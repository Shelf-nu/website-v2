*How Kansas City Art Institute Kept Their Existing Asset Labeling System While Upgrading Their Equipment Management*

When educational institutions consider *switching asset management systems*, one of their biggest concerns is preserving existing investments in hardware and workflows. 

This was exactly the challenge faced by the [Media Center at Kansas City Art Institute (KCAI)](https://kcai.edu/) when they decided to migrate from [Cheqroom](https://www.shelf.nu/alternatives/cheqroom) to Shelf. 

Their story showcases how the right technology partner can make such transitions smooth while protecting prior investments.

## The Starting Point

The KCAI Media Center manages a substantial inventory of equipment that students check out for their creative projects. Their existing setup included DYMO LabelWriter 550 printers, which they used with Cheqroom's system to generate and print QR code labels for their equipment.

> "We use a DYMO LabelWriter 550 to print labels for all of our items," 

> "This was a holdover from our time with Cheqroom as their system could print labels to a DYMO template/printer with one click. This was really convenient and a great investment."

.. explains **Steve Gardels**, Manager of the Media Center. 

## The Migration Challenge

While transitioning to Shelf, the Media Center team encountered an unexpected hurdle. Their existing QR codes, generated through DYMO Connect software, worked perfectly with phone cameras and correctly linked to Shelf URLs. However, these codes **weren't being detected by Shelf's internal scanner** during the crucial "[Scan to Add](https://www.shelf.nu/features/bookings)" process when creating new bookings.

*DYMO Connect Software Version 1.4.2.69 (1.4.2.69)*

The team tried multiple solutions:

- Testing different cameras (iMac FaceTime camera, Logitech C930, IPEVO V4K)
- Adjusting exposure and focus settings
- Experimenting with different QR code format settings in DYMO Connect

Despite these efforts, **Shelf's internal scanner wasn't recognizing their custom-generated codes, threatening to disrupt their efficient equipment check-out process just as the semester was beginning**.

## The Technical Deep Dive

The KCAI team's approach to troubleshooting was methodical and detailed:

- They extracted QR IDs from Shelf's system
- Used spreadsheet functions to format the URLs correctly
- Created a CSV file for DYMO Connect
- Generated test labels that worked with regular QR code scanners
- Validated the URLs were pointing to the correct assets

This thorough analysis helped Shelf's development team understand exactly where the disconnect was occurring between their custom-generated codes and our scanning system.

*Each asset you create in Shelf creates its own QR code and QR ID.*

## Shelf's Solution

Instead of asking KCAI to abandon their existing workflow and hardware investment, we took a different approach: we enhanced our technology. **Our development team updated Shelf's QR code scanning capabilities** to better accommodate externally generated codes, including those from DYMO's label printing software.

This solution delivered multiple benefits:

- Preserved KCAI's investment in DYMO hardware
- Maintained their efficient labeling workflow
- Enabled batch scanning for equipment check-outs
- Required zero additional investment from KCAI

## The Broader Impact

While this enhancement was initially driven by KCAI's needs, its impact extends much further. Any organization using external QR code generation systems can now seamlessly integrate with Shelf. This includes institutions that:

- Use [DYMO](https://www.dymo.com/) or other label printing systems
- Generate QR codes through various software solutions
- Need to maintain existing labeling workflows
- Want to preserve hardware investments while upgrading their asset management

## Technical Implementation Guide

For organizations looking to generate their own QR codes for use with Shelf:

**QR Code Format:**

URL format: <code id="">https://eam.sh/[QR ID]</code>

Works with standard QR code generation software

**Hardware Compatibility:**

Functions across various camera types

Compatible with major label printers

Works in different scanning environments

**Best Practices:**

Test codes with your phone camera AND shelf's built in scanner for validation

Ensure proper CSV formatting for batch generation

Maintain consistent URL structure

*If your QR codes go to https://eam.sh/QRID they will resolve to our servers and we will be able to route them for you.*

## Looking Forward

The successful resolution of KCAI's challenge exemplifies Shelf's commitment to customer success. 

> "When institutions trust us with their transition to Shelf, we're committed to making that transition as smooth as possible," "Sometimes that means adapting our technology to work with their existing systems rather than the other way around." - Carlos Virreira (CEO) Shelf.nu

## For Institutions Considering Migration

If you're considering migrating to a new asset management system, this case study highlights several key considerations:

- Evaluate how new systems will **work with existing hardware**
- Consider **workflow preservation as part of migration planning**
- Look for **technology partners willing to adapt to your needs**
- Factor in the total cost of migration, including potential hardware replacement

## Acknowledgment

A special thank you to Steve Gardels and the KCAI Media Center team for their trust in Shelf and their detailed feedback that helped improve our platform for everyone. Their experience has not only enhanced their own operations but has also made Shelf more flexible and adaptable for all users.
