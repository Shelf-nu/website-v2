## Introducing the New Shelf Progressive Web App

We are excited to announce the launch of the new Shelf progressive web app (PWA)! This PWA makes it easier than ever to access and use Shelf on your mobile devices.

The Shelf PWA brings our **powerful asset management software right to your home screen**. Simply go to [app.shelf.nu](https://app.shelf.nu/) in your mobile browser, tap the "Add to Home Screen" prompt, and you'll have instant access to Shelf whenever you need it.

With the Shelf PWA you can:

- Access Shelf instantly without having to type in a URL or search for the site.
- Enjoy an immersive full screen experience without distracting browser toolbars.
- Add shortcuts to specific pages like your asset dashboard right to your home screen.
- Get the latest features and updates immediately without having to download new versions.
- Enjoy fast, smooth performance with a responsive interface.
- Save space on your device since it's not a native app download.
- Sync seamlessly across devices when used with multiple devices.
- And much more!

In addition to the PWA, we are also working hard on native app versions for all major platforms including **Android**, **iOS**, and **Windows**. This will allow us to publish Shelf on the Google Play Store, Apple App Store, and Windows App Store in the future for those who prefer native apps.

> The Shelf team is dedicated to making asset management as fast and accessible as possible on **any device**. The *progressive web app *is the next step in that journey. We can't wait for you to try it out and let us know what you think!
