In today's fast-paced digital age, businesses need to stay ahead of the curve when it comes to managing their physical assets. One effective way to do this is through QR code asset management. In this blog post, we'll explore the benefits of using QR codes for asset management, how they work, and some best practices for implementing this solution in your organization.

## **What are QR Codes?**

Quick Response (QR) codes are two-dimensional barcodes that store information such as text, URLs, and other data. They can be scanned quickly and easily using smartphones or tablets, making them ideal for inventory management and tracking purposes.

## **What is asset management and how do QR codes relate to it? **

**‍**Asset management refers to the process of managing and optimizing a company's physical assets, such as equipment, vehicles, and machinery, to maximize their value and ensure they are used efficiently. It involves tracking and monitoring assets throughout their lifecycle, including procurement, maintenance, repair, and disposal. QR codes can be used to facilitate [asset management](https://www.shelf.nu/better-asset-management) by providing a quick and easy way to identify and track assets. By affixing a QR code to an asset, users can scan the code with a mobile device and access information such as the asset's ID number, description, location, and maintenance history. This enables companies to quickly locate assets, monitor their usage, and schedule maintenance or repairs when needed, improving overall asset utilization and reducing costs associated with lost or misplaced assets. In addition, QR codes can also be used to track asset movement and detect unauthorized use or tampering, further enhancing asset security and control.

### **Efficient Tracking and Management**

QR code asset management allows you to keep track of your assets efficiently, saving you time and reducing errors. With a simple scan of a QR code, you can access detailed information about each asset, including its location, description, serial number, and maintenance history. This makes it easy to identify missing items, monitor usage, and schedule maintenance.

### **Enhanced Security**

QR codes can also enhance security by allowing only authorized personnel to access certain assets. You can set permissions and restrictions on who can scan specific QR codes, ensuring that sensitive equipment or confidential documents are protected from unauthorized access.

### **Cost Savings**

Implementing QR code asset management can save your business money in several ways. For one, it eliminates the need for expensive software or hardware, as employees can use their personal mobile devices to scan QR codes. Additionally, it reduces the risk of lost or stolen assets, which can result in costly replacements or downtime.

## **How Does QR Code Asset Management Work?**

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how QR code asset management works:

- **Create unique QR codes for each asset:** Use a QR code generator to create distinct codes for every item you want to track. Ensure that the codes are secure and cannot be hijacked by malicious parties to leak out information.
- **Design Asset Tags:** Define the size, requirements and materials where your asset tags will be placed. ([Read all about asset tag materials here](https://www.shelf.nu/blog/how-to-choose-the-best-asset-tags-for-your-equipment)).
- **Attach QR codes to assets:** Stick the generated QR codes onto the assets or attach them via a tag or label.
- **Scan QR codes with a mobile device: **Use a smartphone or tablet to scan the QR code, which will direct you to a web page or app containing the asset's details. *Most mobile phones have native QR support*, which makes QRs a great code type for asset management.
- **Update metadata as needed:** After scanning a QR code, you can edit the associated metadata to reflect changes in the asset's status, location, or condition.

## **Do all phones support QR code scanning via the Camera App?**
