# When to Track vs When to Tag

Not all assets require full workflows. This framework helps teams differentiate.

---

## Assets to Track

Shared, high-value, mobile, operationally critical assets.

See: [Bookings](/features/bookings)  
See: [Custody](/features/custody)

---

## Assets to Tag Only

Static, low-value, or consumable items.

See: [Asset Tagging](/glossary/asset-tagging)

---

## Mixed Cases

Track kits; tag accessories.

See: [Kits](/features/kits)
