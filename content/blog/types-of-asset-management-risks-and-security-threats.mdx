Asset management risks can be divided into two main categories: financial risks and physical risks. Financial risks include the potential for losses due to theft, fraud, and mismanagement. Physical risks refer to the potential for physical damage to the assets, either due to natural disasters such as floods or fires, or due to human error, such as improper handling or maintenance.

Theft can result in the loss of physical assets, as well as the loss of valuable intellectual property. Fraudulent activities, such as accounting fraud or embezzlement, can also lead to losses.

### Natural Disasters

Natural disasters such as floods, fires, and earthquakes can cause extensive damage to physical assets. Businesses should have a plan in place to protect their assets from natural disasters, such as installing backup generators, having a supply of emergency equipment, and developing a response plan for each type of disaster. 

### Human Error

Human error can also lead to losses in asset management. Poor handling and maintenance of assets, such as dropping or mishandling products, can lead to damage or loss. It is important for businesses to have proper training in place for their employees and to have policies in place for handling and maintaining assets.

## Security Threats

In addition to asset management risks, businesses also need to be aware of security threats. Security threats refer to the potential for unauthorized access to assets, either through malicious activity or negligence. Security threats can include theft, hacking, data breaches, malware, and more. To protect against security threats, businesses should invest in a robust security system and regularly update their software. They should also train employees in security protocols and create policies for handling sensitive data.
