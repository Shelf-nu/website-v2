What you can expect is that your current personal or plus account will remain in the personal/plus workspace. 

However, you'll soon be able to **upgrade your account to a Team account**. The Team access will allow you to create a collaborative team environment and workspace where you can add co-administrators.

Co-administrators are asset managers that have the same permissions you do, meaning they can access the database, add/remove items and tags, update locations and costs, and use all the features you're used to. It creates a collaborative team environment for managing assets and features.

We've put the platform into maintenance mode as we work hard to migrate accounts and data to support the new Teams capabilities. We're working as fast as possible to complete this migration. If you have any questions during this maintenance period, please reach out to us via chat.

We're excited for you to try the new Team features once the migration is complete. We've been working hard to create collaborative capabilities that meet your needs. Please share your thoughts once you've had a chance to use the new Teams - we look forward to hearing your feedback!

Thank you for your patience as we complete this upgrade. We appreciate you choosing us and look forward to bringing you more features and capabilities soon.

Let me know if you would like me to modify or expand this draft blog post in any way. I'm happy to incorporate any additional details you'd like covered.
