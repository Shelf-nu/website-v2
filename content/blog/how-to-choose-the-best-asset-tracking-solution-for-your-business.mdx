*Finding the percect asset tracking solution*

## Types of Asset Tracking Solutions

There are five main types of asset tracking solutions that you can use for your business: barcode, QR code, RFID, GPS, and IoT. Let’s take a look at each one and see how they work.

### Barcode

Barcode asset tracking is one of the most common and widely used methods of asset tracking. It involves attaching barcode labels to your assets and scanning them with a barcode scanner or a mobile device to record and update their information.

Barcode asset tracking is relatively simple, low-cost, and easy to implement. It can help you identify and locate your assets quickly and accurately. However, barcode asset tracking also has some limitations, such as:

- Requiring line-of-sight scanning
- Being prone to damage or wear-and-tear
- Having limited data storage capacity

### QR code

[QR code asset](https://www.shelf.nu/blog/qr-code-asset-tagging-revolutionizing-asset-management-and-tracking) tracking is another method of asset tracking that uses a type of 2D barcode that can store more data than a regular barcode. It involves attaching QR code labels to your assets and scanning them with a QR code scanner or a mobile device to record and update their information.

QR code asset tracking has some advantages over barcode asset tracking, such as:

- Not requiring line-of-sight scanning
- Being more durable and resistant to damage or wear-and-tear
- Having higher data storage capacity

However, QR code asset tracking also has some drawbacks, such as:

- Being more expensive than barcode labels
- Having potential readability issues with low-quality scanners or cameras
- Requiring internet connection to access some data

With Shelf, you can easily use QR code asset tracking for your business. You can print or order QR code labels from within the app and attach them to your assets. You can then scan them with your smartphone or tablet camera and update their information on the spot. You can also view and edit your asset information on any device with an internet connection.

*Shelf offers QR codes for all your assets and use cases*

### RFID

RFID (radio-frequency identification) asset tracking is another popular method of asset tracking. It involves attaching RFID tags to your assets and using RFID readers or antennas to capture and transmit their data wirelessly.

RFID asset tracking has several advantages over barcode or QR code asset tracking, such as:

- Not requiring line-of-sight scanning
- Being more durable and resistant to harsh environments
- Having higher data storage capacity

However, RFID asset tracking also has some drawbacks, such as:

- Being more expensive than barcode or QR code labels
- Having potential interference issues with other devices or materials
- Requiring more complex installation and maintenance

In Shelf, you can use NFC Stickers for asset tracking. You have to order them via our website or app. We will create them and deliver them to your door! 

> **NFC is a subset of RFID technology** that was initially designed to support short-range communication for mobile devices. Through magnetic field induction, NFC enables two devices to send messages when they're near one another.

### GPS

GPS (global positioning system) asset tracking is a method of asset tracking that uses GPS satellites to determine the location of your assets. It involves attaching GPS trackers to your assets and using a web-based or mobile platform to view their location on a map.

GPS asset tracking is ideal for tracking assets that move frequently or across long distances, such as vehicles or containers. It can help you monitor your asset movements, routes, speed, and performance in real-time. However, GPS asset tracking also has some challenges, such as:

- Being dependent on network coverage and signal strength
- Being affected by weather conditions or obstructions
- Having higher power consumption and battery drain

### IoT

IoT (internet of things) asset tracking is a method of asset tracking that uses IoT devices and sensors to collect and transmit data from your assets over the internet . It involves connecting your assets to a cloud-based or on-premise platform that analyzes and displays their data .

IoT asset tracking is the most advanced and versatile method of asset tracking . It can help you track not only the location but also the condition and status of your assets in real-time . It can also help you automate your asset management processes , optimize your asset performance , and prevent potential issues or failures . However , IoT asset tracking also has some challenges , such as :

- Being more complex and costly to implement and maintain
- Requiring high-level security and privacy measures
- Having compatibility issues with different devices or platforms
