Discover how Shelf's seven custom field types can transform your asset management. From simple text fields to complex financial tracking, learn which field types work best for your equipment and how to configure them for maximum efficiency.

Managing assets isn't one-size-fits-all. Your camera equipment needs different data than your office furniture. Your lab instruments require different tracking than your vehicles. That's why we've built **seven powerful custom field types** that let you capture exactly the information that matters for your unique assets.

## Quick Overview: All 7 Custom Field Types

Here's what you can track with Shelf's custom fields:

- **Single-line text** – Serial numbers, model codes, short notes
- **Multi-line text** – Detailed descriptions, setup instructions
- **Number** – Quantities, measurements, technical specs
- **Amount** – Costs, values, financial data (with currency formatting)
- **Option** – Dropdown menus for consistent categorization
- **Boolean** – Yes/no checkboxes for quick status checks
- **Date** – Schedules, expiration dates, milestones

Let's dive into when and how to use each one.

## Text Fields: The Foundation of Asset Information

### Single-Line Text: Quick Identifiers

**Best for:** Any short piece of text that identifies or describes your asset.

**Perfect when you need to track:**

- Serial numbers and asset tags
- Model numbers and SKU codes
- Employee names and user assignments
- Room numbers and location codes
- Vendor names and contact information

> **Pro tip:** Use single-line text for any information you might need to search for quickly. It's perfect for creating your own [naming conventions](https://www.shelf.nu/blog/top-pc-naming-conventions-for-system-admins).

### Multi-Line Text: Detailed Information

**Best for:** Longer descriptions that need formatting and line breaks.

**Essential for capturing:**

- Setup and operating instructions
- Maintenance history and service notes
- Technical specifications and requirements
- Troubleshooting guides
- Special handling procedures
- Return policies and conditions

> **Real-world example:** A film production company uses multi-line text to store camera setup configurations for different shoots, so any crew member can quickly recreate the exact settings.

## Numeric Fields: Measurements and Money

### Number Field: Technical Specifications

**Best for:** Any numeric value that isn't money – measurements, quantities, ratings, specifications.

**Track important metrics like:**

- Power consumption and voltage ratings
- Weight, dimensions, and capacity limits
- Quantities in stock or available
- Performance ratings and specifications
- Temperature ranges and environmental limits
- Screen sizes, memory capacity, storage space

### Amount Field: Financial Tracking

**Best for:** Any monetary value – automatically formats as currency for clarity.

**Essential for financial oversight:**

- Purchase prices and current market values
- Daily, weekly, or monthly rental rates
- Maintenance costs and service expenses
- Insurance coverage amounts
- Replacement and depreciation values
- Lease payments and financing costs

> **Why separate Number and Amount fields?** Amount fields automatically format with currency symbols and proper decimal places, making financial reports cleaner and more professional.

## Selection and Status Fields: Consistency and Control

### Option Field: Standardized Choices

**Best for:** When you need consistent, standardized data entry across your team.

**Create dropdown menus for:**

- Equipment categories (lighting, audio, video, computing)
- Condition status (excellent, good, fair, needs repair)
- Manufacturers and brands
- Priority levels (low, medium, high, critical)
- Project phases and workflow stages
- Rental periods (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly)

> **Data consistency tip:** Option fields prevent typos and variations in your data. Instead of getting "Canon", "canon", "CANON", and "Canon Inc." – you get exactly what you defined.

### Boolean Field: Quick Status Checks

**Best for:** Simple yes/no or true/false conditions that you need to check at a glance.

**Perfect for tracking:**

- Certification status (calibrated, certified, compliant)
- Safety requirements (requires training, hazardous material)
- Insurance and warranty coverage
- Maintenance needs (needs service, up to date)
- Special conditions (waterproof, fragile, temperature-sensitive)

### Date Field: Time-Based Management

**Best for:** Any time-sensitive information that affects asset management decisions.

**Critical for tracking:**

- Purchase and installation dates
- Warranty and insurance expiration
- Scheduled maintenance dates
- Calibration and certification due dates
- Expected replacement timelines
- Lease and contract renewals

> **Automation opportunity:** Combined with Shelf's [reminder system](https://www.shelf.nu/features/asset-reminders), date fields can automatically notify you before important deadlines.

## Advanced Configuration Options

Every custom field can be fine-tuned with these powerful options:

### Required Fields

Make certain information mandatory to ensure your team captures critical data every time.

### Help Text

Provide clear guidance and examples for data entry – especially useful for complex or technical fields.

### Category Linking

Apply specific fields only to relevant [asset categories](https://www.shelf.nu/knowledge-base/using-categories-to-organize-your-asset-inventory). For example, show "Calibration Date" only for lab equipment.

### Active/Inactive Control

Temporarily disable fields without losing data – perfect when requirements change or you're testing new workflows.

### Example: Setting Up an Option Field

Here's how you might configure a status tracking field:

```json
{
  "name": "Equipment Status",
  "type": "option",
  "options": ["Available", "Checked Out", "In Repair", "Retired"],
  "helpText": "Current operational status - updates automatically with bookings",
  "required": true,
  "categories": ["Audio Equipment", "Video Equipment"]
}
```

## Real-World Success Stories

### Event Production Company

"We use Option fields for equipment types and Boolean fields to track which gear needs special transport cases. Date fields remind us about gear that needs annual safety inspections. It's transformed how we prepare for shoots."

### Research Laboratory

"Amount fields track the cost of each instrument for grant reporting, while Date fields manage calibration schedules. Number fields store technical specifications that our researchers need for experiment planning."

### IT Department

"Single-line text for asset tags, Boolean fields for warranty status, and Date fields for replacement planning. Our [IT asset tracking](https://www.shelf.nu/solutions/it-asset-tracking) has never been more organized."

## Getting Started with Custom Fields

### Step 1: Plan Your Data

Before creating fields, ask yourself:

- What information do we need to make decisions about this asset?
- What data would help during audits or inspections?
- What questions do we frequently ask about our equipment?

### Step 2: Start Simple

Begin with the most essential fields. You can always add more as your needs evolve.

### Step 3: Get Your Team Involved

The people who use the assets daily often know what information would be most valuable to track.

### Step 4: Test and Refine

Create a few assets with your custom fields and see how they work in practice. Adjust as needed.
