## What Are Asset Tags and Their Purpose?

Now that you understand a little bit about asset labels and tags and why people find them useful, let us dive deeper into explaining exactly what these products entail and their significance for businesses and organizations.

‍

Dimensions in this guide are both in inches (US standard units - imperial) as well as centimeters (European standard units - metric).

‍

Now, let’s take a closer examination of this product category and unpack its critical components.

‍

## Defining Asset Tags 

First, let’s define exactly what constitutes an "asset tag." An asset tag represents an item capable of being cataloged for organizational tracking purposes. 

‍

These labels help identify unique pieces of equipment, tools, or other tangible possessions. They often contain information that helps administrators quickly locate and manage said assets accordingly. 

‍

This includes serial numbers, barcodes, QR codes, RFID chips, contactless smart cards, digital watermarks, or even plain text descriptions. 

‍

Each method provides distinct advantages over traditional ID methods; however, some technologies remain far more practical than others due to limitations related to the environment, budget constraints, accessibility, or desired functionality. 

‍

We will touch on this topic later on during the discussion regarding material choices.

*Spotless co inc used to be a mail-order house with thousands of products, based in Richmond, VA. Mostly known for its car tires.*

‍

Since then, the market exploded thanks to growing demand from corporate America, fueled largely by improved mechanization and computerized database integration.

‍

Today, nearly all industries utilize these identifying marks to streamline processes and protect investments. 

‍

From grocery store produce stickers to automobiles’ VIN decals, this modern-day necessity serves our society in countless ways. 

‍

No longer just the domain of mass-produced goods, these solutions expanded into the realm of tracking office equipment, expensive medical devices, transport vehicles, construction equipment, IT supplies, livestock, military assets, event tickets, museum relics, and much more. Companies seeking to minimize loss or enhance accountability employ asset tags.

‍

## Understanding Different Types of Asset Label Materials

Such a broad technology has also a broad availability of materials to pick from. The most popular materials for asset labels or asset tags are polypropylene, paper, PVC, vinyl, Tyvek®, aluminum, brass, stainless steel, and polyester film. 

‍

There are tradeoffs between durability, flexibility, cost, ease of printing, scanning, adhesives, and exposure conditions for each material. 

‍

### Paper - Flexibility & Affordability

As a universal medium, paper's pliability makes it compatible with numerous die sizes, software programs, finishing equipment, and adhesives. Lower-cost hardware and supplies also promote its prevalence among businesses. Its versatility encompasses almost any type of printed content imaginable. However, this same adaptability means less specialized performance features must be sacrificed to support so many potential uses. Paper tags usually perform poorest overall for demanding industrial, food service, or hospital settings, whereas their affordability keeps them ideal for basic indoor office use, general merchandise identification, gift shop merchandising, event signage, party favors, home storage organization, or name badges. Paper cannot match the rigid, scuff-, crack-, scratch-, fade-, or water-resistance properties provided by harder substrates like other tag materials here.

### Polypropylene (“Poly”) - Strength & Cost Efficiency

High mechanical toughness helps poly survive rough treatment without breaking. Being relatively light yet robust delivers added benefits for those who want the best of both worlds – great functionality combined with minimal strain on adhered objects. When coupled with excellent cold crack/break resistance, its freeze-thaw stability grants additional winter outdoor operational capacity without degradation. Poly labels display better resistance to most solvents, acids, caustics, and bases, except concentrated sodas, red wine/coffee hot liquids, and certain alcohols, oils, etc. Because poly lacks sufficient heat fusion to enable use with a vast majority of toners and foils, only direct thermal

### Tyvek® - Durability & Wide Temperature Range

Developed by DuPont, Tyvek® provides durability similar to but greater flexibility than ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). As a synthetic material, Tyvek offers exceptional tear resistance and puncture resistance, even when subjected to sharp object impacts. Withstanding extreme cold down to around minus 70 degrees Fahrenheit and surviving exposure to higher temperatures beyond 300 degrees Fahrenheit during short periods, Tyvek excels where prolonged exposure isn't anticipated. 

‍

Greater moisture vapor transmission rates help reduce mold growth. While this branded spun-bonded olefin fiber does suffer some damage due to deteriorating effects from extended exposure to sunlight along with weaker oil/solvent resistance, it has broader applicability and remains popular. Tyvek serves well in construction sites, agricultural areas, manufacturing plants, warehouses, commercial kitchens, or anywhere exposure might occur amid extreme conditions. Uses vary between safety garments, wristbands, chart covers, envelopes, book covers, gaskets, banners, graphic displays, maps, and signs.

### Aluminum - Longevity & Versatility

Metallic assets benefit from extended outside deployments, particularly those involving frequent contact with liquid chemicals or gasoline. These sturdier elements endure through cycles of high/low temperatures, which increases their value for rugged applications where plastic alternatives are insufficient. Customizable finishes allow incorporation into finished goods as part of the products themselves. 

‍

Besides traditional industries, aluminum works well for applications requiring exposure to salty ocean air (marine/water sports), salt spreading/melting agents, road salts, fertilizers/weed killers, pool/spa chemicals, chlorine bleach solutions, fruits, vegetables, and meat processing washdowns, insecticides/pesticides, ammonia/bleaches, animal hormones, plus pressure washing. 

‍

For decorative purposes or more formal occasions, painting, powder coating, milling, etching, ing, laser cutting, photo anodizing, polishing, brushing, embossing, engraving, screen printing, or electroplating expands metal's usefulness in artwork, promotional items, fine jewelry, or designer showcases. Unlike polyester, silver, gold, copper, bronze, or brass metals won't corrode over time thanks to natural oxidation or galvanic reactions occurring upon contact with dissimilar metals or humid environments containing sulfur compounds.

### Anodized Aluminum - Weather Resistance & Customization Potential

Similar to regular aluminum, weather resistance is improved with anodization to create a ceramic layer that enhances hardening under electrical impulses to form a superficial film. This modification can increase protection against UV radiation while increasing color options through various dying methods. The tradeoff involves cost since adding this step raises production prices. 

‍

Typical applications include plaques/signage, door pulls/handles, architectural trim, lighting components, outdoor furniture, kitchen utensils, marine, automotive aftermarket accessories, firearms, and medical devices. Some users prefer not to use metallic alloys where continuous submergence will take place or where highly acidic substance exposures could degrade the base alloy or colored finishes. For harsh environment utilization, special coatings may be required.

### Stainless Steel - Corrosion Resistance & Aesthetics

The iron–chromium alloy forms a passivation layer resistant to atmospheric attacks; however, it remains susceptible to microscopic cracks leading to localized corrosion if proper processing controls aren't maintained. Nickel-free grades provide more resistance to pitting caused by chloride ion stress corrosion. Stamping or machining stainless steel allows the creation of custom shapes based on product requirements. 

‍

This long-lasting material often sees use in the food/beverage industry, pharmaceuticals, breweries, dairy farming, winery operations, laboratory testing facilities, hospitals, sterile room settings, clean rooms, x-ray darkrooms, research labs, and many more.
