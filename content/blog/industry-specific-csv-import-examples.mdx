As the founder of Shelf, I've seen firsthand how proper asset management can transform operations across various industries. One of the most powerful features of Shelf is its ability to import existing asset data via CSV files. To help you get started, we've created a set of industry-specific CSV templates that you can use as a starting point for your own asset management journey.

- **Industry-Specific Fields:** Each template includes fields relevant to its respective industry, giving you ideas for what to track.
- **Customization:** Use these as a base and add your own custom fields to suit your unique needs.

### Best Practices for CSV Imports

- Ensure your data is clean and consistent before importing.
- Use unique identifiers for each asset (e.g., serial numbers or asset tags).
- Standardize data formats, especially for dates and currency values.
- Consider using our [QR code asset tags](/asset-tags) for easy scanning and updates.
