We're thrilled to announce some major upgrades to our user interface that will take your asset management experience to the next level!

## Mobile Improvements:

- When you scan a tag, a convenient action list pops up, allowing you to perform quick actions on the go.

## Enhanced Tag Management:

- Edit tags, categories, and more with ease.
- Experience a fresh new look and feel for tags, making it easier to identify and manage your assets.

## Location-Based Asset Index:

- Now, you can view the location of an object directly on the asset index, streamlining your search process.

## Powerful Vector Database:

- Our latest integration upgrade - a new vector database - ensures lightning-fast searches for all users. This pairs perfectly with our recently launched custom fields feature, giving you unparalleled control over your inventory searching capabilities.

## Combined Search Functionality:

- The cherry on top? You can now combine search parameters using the search bar! Try it out:
- Asset name (space) category (space) owner

> Example: "Carlos Virreira Needs Maintenance Office A" will display all items in Office A, labeled 'needs maintenance', belonging to Carlos Virreira.
