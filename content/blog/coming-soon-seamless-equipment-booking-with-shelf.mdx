As your team grows and acquires more assets, keeping track of who needs what equipment and when can get tricky --fast. We want to eliminate the confusion, double bookings, and missed opportunities from poor coordination.

## Get more ROI out of your assets

We have some exciting news to share with the Shelf community today – we’re **currently developing** a new asset booking feature to make reserving shared assets smoother and simpler than ever!

As your team grows and acquires more assets, keeping track of who needs what equipment and when can get tricky --*fast.* We want to eliminate the confusion, double bookings, and missed opportunities from poor coordination.

That's why we're working on rolling out robust booking capabilities right within your Shelf account. Here's a rundown of how it will work:

- Calendar View of Availability
Easily see at a glance when an asset is currently booked and available slots open for reserving. No more guessing if something can be taken or used.
‍

- Bookings
Your asset manager can submit reservations. Automated notifications keep everyone on the same page.
‍

- Custom Booking Fields
Tailor booking forms to collect critical information like booking dates, purpose, pickup details etc. to reduce back and forth.

We're really excited to introduce booking functionality because we know it's a major pain point for many of you. **Smoother equipment sharing ultimately means better productivity and asset ROI.**

This feature is still in active development, so we'd love to hear your feedback on how booking is handled at your organization currently. What are the biggest headaches? What capabilities would make the biggest impact?

We want to make sure we're building the most useful solution to meet your needs. Please reach out with any thoughts on how we can create the [best equipment](https://www.shelf.nu/blog/how-to-choose-the-best-asset-tags-for-your-equipment) booking system possible.

If you want to talk about this [feature](https://www.shelf.nu/features) with our head of product, Carlos -- do not hesitate in booking 1:1 time with him, [here](https://cal.com/shelf/demo).

Stay tuned for more updates as we get closer to launch. We can't wait to eliminate the equipment booking hassle, so you can focus on what matters most. Better asset sharing is coming soon to a Shelf account near you.

Let us know if you need any clarification or have additional questions.
