Spreadsheets cannot support real equipment workflows.

---

## 1. No Responsibility Tracking
See: [Custody](/features/custody)

---

## 2. No Booking Conflict Prevention
See: [Bookings](/features/bookings)

---

## 3. Not Real-Time
People forget to update them; versions drift.

---

## 4. No Workflow Support
See: [Kits](/features/kits)  
See: [Asset Reminders](/features/asset-reminders)

---

## 5. No Asset History
Spreadsheets lack audit trails.

---

## Conclusion

Modern asset tracking replaces manual spreadsheets with real workflows.
