Discover how our latest feature can help you assign team members as custodians of specific assets, promote accountability, enhance security, streamline audits, and optimize collaboration.

Are you tired of manually keeping track of who has access to your company's valuable equipment? Do you struggle to maintain a clear overview of your assets' whereabouts and custody? Our latest feature, Custodians, is here to revolutionize the way you manage your assets. With Custodians, you can easily assign team members as custodians of specific assets, providing a seamless way to track and manage access to your equipment.

## Story

Meet **John**, an **equipment manager** who's responsible for managing a large **inventory of expensive machinery**. In the past, John relied on the comment section of his shelf asset page(s) to keep track of who had access to each piece of equipment. However, this method proved to be cumbersome and inefficient. John wanted a better solution, one that would allow him to quickly identify which assets were assigned to which team members.

## Solution

We heard John's plea, and our development team worked tirelessly to create a feature that would address his concerns. Introducing Custodians – a game-changing addition to our already powerful asset management system. Now, John can go to **Settings > Workspaces** and add team members (who don't need to have their own accounts) as custodians of specific assets. This allows him to effortlessly assign and track custody of equipment, ensuring that everything is properly accounted for.

## How it works

With Custodians, John can now easily assign custody of an asset to a team member by selecting their name from a dropdown menu on the asset's explore page. This creates a **clear audit trail **of who has access to each asset, allowing John to **monitor and manage his equipment with confidence**. Plus, the custodian change will be logged as an event on the asset explore page, making auditing easy and intuitive.

## Benefits

The benefits of using Custodians extend beyond mere convenience. By assigning custody of assets to specific team members, you can:

- *Enhance Security:* Limiting access to authorized personnel helps prevent unauthorized usage, loss, or damage to your valuable equipment.
- *Streamline Audits:* With Custodians, conducting regular audits becomes a breeze. You'll have all the information you need in one place, making it easy to identify discrepancies and resolve issues promptly.
- *Optimize Collaboration:* By involving team members in the asset management process, you foster collaboration and shared responsibility, leading to a more efficient and productive workflow.
