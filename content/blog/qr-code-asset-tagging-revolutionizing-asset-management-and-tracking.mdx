## Understanding QR Codes

QR codes have become increasingly prevalent in today's digital landscape, revolutionizing the way we interact with information. In this section, we will explore what QR codes are, how they work, and the different types of QR codes available.

### What are QR Codes?

A QR code, short for Quick Response code, is a two-dimensional barcode that can store a significant amount of data. Created in 1994 by the Japanese automotive industry, QR codes were initially used to track vehicle parts. However, their potential expanded beyond the automotive sector, and they are now used in various industries, including marketing, inventory management, and asset tracking.

A QR code consists of a series of black squares arranged on a white background, typically resembling a square shape. These black squares encode the information stored within the QR code. QR codes have the advantage of being easily scannable by smartphones or dedicated QR code scanners, making them highly accessible to a wide range of users.

![](https://qliecghuzfchfjwaisyx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/website-images/blog/why-qr-important.jpg)

### How do QR Codes work?

QR codes work by encoding information into a pattern that can be deciphered by scanning devices. When a QR code is scanned using a smartphone or a QR code scanner, the device's camera captures the code's image, and specialized software decodes the pattern to reveal the stored information.

The information contained within a QR code can vary depending on the intended use. This data can include website URLs, text, contact information, email addresses, Wi-Fi network details, or even multimedia files such as images or videos. Once the information is decoded, users can access the linked content, perform actions, or gain additional insights.

### Types of QR Codes

There are two main types of QR codes: static QR codes and dynamic QR codes.

#### Static QR Codes

Static QR codes contain fixed information that cannot be changed once generated. This type of QR code is suitable for scenarios where the encoded data remains constant, such as linking to a website or providing contact information. Static QR codes are easy to generate and widely used for basic applications.

#### Dynamic QR Codes

Dynamic QR codes, on the other hand, offer more flexibility and functionality. Unlike static QR codes, dynamic QR codes allow for the modification of the encoded information even after the code is generated. This means that if the linked content needs to be updated or changed, the dynamic QR code can be edited without the need to generate a new code. Dynamic QR codes are commonly used for inventory management, marketing campaigns, and asset tracking, where real-time updates may be required.

> **Did you know? **Shelf asset QR codes are considered to be dynamic. As they are linked to the asset but they can be swapped at any point (a new code can be generated for the same asset if needed)

### Popular QR Code Generators and Scanners

To create QR codes, there are a plethora of online QR code generators available that allow users to input their desired information and generate a customized QR code. Some popular QR code generator platforms include QRCode Monkey, QRStuff, and Kaywa.

To scan QR codes, users can utilize dedicated QR code scanner apps available for smartphones or use the built-in QR code scanning functionality of certain [mobile devices](https://www.shelf.nu/blog/qr-code-scanning-on-mobile-devices-a-comprehensive-guide). Commonly used QR code scanner apps include QR Code Reader by Scan, QR Scanner by Kaspersky, and NeoReader.

QR codes have become ubiquitous in various industries due to their ease of use, versatility, and the ability to store a wealth of information. In the next section, we will explore the process of implementing QR Code Asset Tagging, from planning and preparation to the creation and application of QR code asset tags.
