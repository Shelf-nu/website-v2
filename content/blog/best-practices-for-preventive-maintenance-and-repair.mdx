At Shelf, we understand that preventive maintenance and repair are complex processes, and we’re here to help. In this blog post, we’ll provide an overview of best practices to help you protect the value of your assets and keep them running as smoothly as possible.

## 1. Establish a Preventive Maintenance Plan

The first step in preventive maintenance and repair is to create a plan that outlines how often each asset should be inspected and maintained. Depending on the type of asset and its expected lifespan, preventive maintenance activities can vary from weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually. It’s important to ensure that you’re inspecting and maintaining your assets at the appropriate intervals to ensure their proper functioning.

To create a preventive maintenance plan, you should identify the assets that need to be maintained, the frequency of inspections and maintenance, and the necessary tools and personnel. This plan should also include a list of common issues and potential solutions to help you quickly identify and address problems. Additionally, it’s important to document the preventive maintenance and repair process to ensure that it’s being followed properly.

## 2. Utilize QR Asset Tags

QR asset tags are an essential part of any preventive maintenance and repair plan. These tags are designed to help you quickly and accurately identify assets, as well as track maintenance activities. When placed on an asset, a QR asset tag can provide real-time information about its condition, location, and maintenance history.

## 3. Perform Regular Inspections

Regular inspections are the cornerstone of any preventive maintenance and repair plan. By regularly inspecting assets, you can identify potential problems before they become significant issues. During each inspection, you should check for signs of wear and tear, such as cracks, rust, or other damage. If any issues are identified, you should address them as soon as possible.

## 4. Implement a Repair Management System

Once you’ve identified an issue, it’s essential to have a repair management system in place to quickly address the problem. This system should include a process for ordering replacement parts, scheduling repairs, and tracking progress. Additionally, it should provide visibility into the repair process to ensure it’s being conducted efficiently and effectively.

If you notice any abnormalities, it’s important to address them as soon as possible to avoid costly repairs or breakdowns.
