## A new foundation

We are excited to announce the launch of **Shelf V2**. We noticed that many asset tracking tools were stuck in the past—clunky, slow, and hard to use on mobile devices. We wanted to build something different.

### Key Improvements
*   **Blazing Fast Interface:** Built on Next.js for instant page loads.
*   **Offline Mode:** Keep working even when the connection drops.
*   **Enhanced API:** Connect Shelf to your existing ERP or ticketing system.
