## Determining Your Asset Label Needs

Before we begin printing your asset labels, we need to determine a few things. First, we'll ask if you want to label your existing inventory or if you need labels for assets that haven't been created yet. The great news is that we can accommodate both scenarios! We can print asset labels for your existing inventory as well as reserve labels for future use. This way, you'll always have a supply of labels on hand whenever you need them.

## Choosing the Right Size and Material

Once we know how many assets you need labels for, we'll work with you to select the right size and material for your labels. We offer a variety of materials, including PVC, which is our most popular choice due to its durability and versatility. We typically print our asset labels on an A5-sized sheet of PVC, which makes them easy to handle and transport. Plus, it allows us to ship them internationally faster and more efficiently.

## Calculating the Cost and Production Time

After we've determined the size and material of your asset labels, we'll calculate the number of labels that fit on an A5 sheet and provide you with a detailed proposal. Our proposals include all the necessary information about the production process, including pricing and turnaround time. We take care of shipping and taxes, so you don't have to worry about anything except receiving your asset labels. If you need expedited delivery, we can arrange that too!
