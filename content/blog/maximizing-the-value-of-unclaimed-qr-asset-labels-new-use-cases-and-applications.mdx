## A new way to use your unclaimed asset labels

**Hello Shelf Community!**

We're excited to announce a new feature that will make your asset tagging process even smoother. With Shelf, our goal is to provide you with world-class infrastructure and functionality to easily register, tag, and track all your assets. And with our latest update, we've made it simpler than ever to create and manage your asset labels.
‍

One of the biggest challenges our users face is procurement of asset labels. Some companies struggle with creating a complete import sheet to Shelf, followed by exporting each code and producing it. Others prefer requesting unclaimed asset labels from our team, which can take time and effort. However, we understand that you need a solution that's efficient and hassle-free.

‍

## Link an unclaimed tag to an existing asset

That's why we've introduced a game-changing feature: the ability to scan [unclaimed QR codes](https://www.shelf.nu/blog/what-are-unclaimed-asset-labels-on-shelf-and-what-are-they-used-for) and link them to existing assets or create new ones. Now, whenever you scan an unclaimed QR code, you'll have two options: register a new asset or link it to an existing one. This means you can produce unclaimed labels, place them on your objects, and easily integrate them into your workspace database. No more coordinating with our team or worrying about reprinting QR codes.
‍

But that's not all. We also offer unclaimed QR codes upon request for all Plus and Team Plan users. This means you can gradually build your database without having to manually create and print QR codes for every single asset. Just request the unclaimed codes, and you'll be able to assign them to your assets in no time.
‍

Here's an example scenario to illustrate how this feature can benefit you:
‍

> Let's say you're a facilities manager responsible for maintaining a large office building. You have hundreds of assets scattered throughout the building, including chairs, tables, computers, and printers. In the past, you would have had to create a spreadsheet with all the necessary information, import it into Shelf, and then export and print individual QR codes for each asset. With our new feature, you can simply request unclaimed QR codes, place them on the assets, and scan them to link them to your existing Shelf database. It's that easy!
