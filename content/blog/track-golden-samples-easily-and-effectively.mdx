## What are golden samples?

Golden samples, also called approval samples, are samples that your manufacturer sends to you before mass production. They represent a perfectly-made product that completely aligns with your product quality standards. They are the result of an approval process that works as follows:

- The supplier sends you pre-production samples.
- You check the samples and either approve or reject them.
- If rejected, the supplier produces new samples.
- Once approved, the supplier can start production.

You will need to save the final samples, and they should be signed, dated, and sealed. Generally, you will need several of them:

- One for the manufacturer to hold on to.
- Some samples for your third-party inspectors.
- One for you to keep for your reference.

These samples serve as a standard for comparison to all future production goods. They help you set expectations with your manufacturer and prevent quality fade.

*Golden samples help save valuable production time and avoid potential disputes with your manufacturer*

Golden samples are important because they help you ensure product quality and consistency throughout mass production. They also help you avoid disputes and misunderstandings with your manufacturer.

For example, let's say you're making ceramic mugs and an issue develops with their color after a year or two. They are coming off the line in what appears to be candy red, but they are supposed to have more of a deep crimson red. Your supplier argues that they're red, just like you requested, so you pull out the approval sample for a side-by-side comparison. Upon examining it, the supplier can clearly see there is a significant difference and that they need to remake the mugs.

Without a golden sample, you would have no objective way to prove that the color has changed over time. You would have to rely on your memory or subjective perception, which could lead to arguments and delays.

Another example is when you lose or damage your golden samples. This can happen due to accidents, thefts, natural disasters, or human errors. If you don't have a backup copy of your golden samples, you might have trouble reproducing them or verifying their quality.

For instance, one of our customers had a fire in their warehouse that destroyed their golden samples along with their inventory. They had no other way to check if their new production goods matched their quality standards. They had to go through the approval process again with their manufacturer, which cost them time and money.
