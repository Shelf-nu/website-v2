## Full asset visibility for your IT Assets

If you're responsible for managing computer hardware in a business environment, you know how important it is to keep track of your assets. Whether you're dealing with laptops, desktops, servers, or other network devices, it's crucial to have a clear understanding of what you have, where it's located, and who has access to it.

One effective way to accomplish this is by using [asset tags](https://www.shelf.nu/asset-tags). Also known as **PC asset tags**, these small labels contain a *unique identifier*, such as a **QR code**, **Barcode** or **RFID chip**, that can be attached to individual devices to facilitate inventory tracking and management.

By utilizing PC asset tags, businesses can efficiently monitor and maintain their computer hardware, including laptops, desktops, servers, routers, switches, and other network devices. This approach helps organizations to:

- **Easily identify and locate devices:** Asset tags allow IT teams to quickly spot and retrieve specific devices within a crowded server room or storage area, saving time and effort during routine maintenance, upgrades, or troubleshooting.

- **Keep accurate inventory records:** By scanning the asset tag, businesses can update their inventory database in real-time, ensuring that they have an accurate record of all devices, their locations, and their current status.

- **Track device usage and maintenance history:** Asset tags enable companies to maintain a detailed history of each device, including purchase dates, warranty information, maintenance schedules, and past issues. This information helps businesses make informed decisions regarding upgrades, replacement, and maintenance.

- **Optimize asset lifecycle management:** With asset tags, businesses can effectively manage the entire lifecycle of their computer hardware, from procurement to disposal. This includes monitoring usage patterns, identifying underutilized resources, and determining the best time for upgrades or replacements.

- **Enhance security:** Asset tags can help prevent unauthorized access or tampering with sensitive equipment, as well as deter theft. This is particularly important for businesses operating in high-security environments, such as government agencies, financial institutions, or healthcare providers.

- **Streamline auditing and compliance:** Asset tags simplify the process of conducting audits and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. During audits, businesses can quickly demonstrate the existence and proper management of all computer hardware, minimizing the risk of non-compliance penalties.

- **Facilitate collaboration:** Asset tags can be used to assign responsibility for device maintenance, updates, and troubleshooting, promoting teamwork and collaboration among IT staff members.

- **Save time and reduce errors:** By automating inventory tracking and management tasks, businesses can eliminate manual errors and save time for IT personnel, allowing them to focus on higher-level responsibilities.

## **Creating and Implementing a PC Asset Tagging System**

Now that we've discussed the benefits of using PC asset tags, let's take a closer look at how to create and implement a comprehensive asset tracking system.

### **Define Asset Categories and Labeling Conventions**

To begin, you'll need to define asset categories and labeling conventions for your organization. This could include grouping assets by department, location, or type. You may also want to create a standard naming convention for your assets, such as using a combination of letters and numbers to identify specific devices.

### **Choose Appropriate Asset Tagging Technologies**

There are several asset tagging technologies to choose from, including barcode scanning, RFID, and NFC. Each has its own set of pros and cons, so it's essential to select the one that best fits your organization's needs and budget. For example, if you have limited resources and a smaller number of assets to track, barcode scanning might be a good option. On the other hand, if you have a larger number of assets and require real-time tracking capabilities, RFID or NFC might be better suited for your needs.

### **Procedures for Applying and Tracking Asset Tags**

Once you've chosen your asset tagging technology, you'll need to develop procedures for applying and tracking asset tags. This could involve assigning unique identifier codes to each asset, creating a database or spreadsheet to store asset information, and establishing guidelines for regularly updating asset records.

### **Automating PC Asset Tracking with Software and Services**

Manually tracking PC assets can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Fortunately, there are many software and service solutions available that can automate the process for you.
