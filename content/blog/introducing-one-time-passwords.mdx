Dear valued Shelf users,

We're writing to inform you about an important update regarding how you access your Shelf account. To enhance the security and reliability of our platform, we are transitioning from using Magic Links to a more robust solution called One-Time Passwords (OTP). This change comes after identifying certain limitations with Magic Links, particularly when used alongside Microsoft Safe Links.

## Reason for implementing OTP

By implementing OTP, we aim to provide a more reliable experience while logging into your Shelf accounts and addressing any previous issues related to Microsoft Safe Links. Unlike Magic Links, which could sometimes expire or be intercepted, OTP ensures secure authentication through instantaneously generated codes sent directly to your registered email address.

Here's what you need to know:

To use OTP instead of Magic link:

- Add your email to the OTP input box
- Check your email for the verification code
- Input the received code within the designated box
- Complete your login process

New registrations on Shelf will automatically utilize the One-Time Password system for improved security and convenience.

Please rest assured that our commitment remains focused on providing you with seamless access to your digital assets and ensuring top-notch user experiences. The introduction of One-Time Passwords represents another step toward delivering enhanced functionality and peace of mind for everyone utilizing Shelf services.
