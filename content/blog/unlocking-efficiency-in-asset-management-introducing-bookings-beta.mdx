## **Unlocking Efficiency in Asset Management: Introducing 'Bookings' by Shelf**

In the realm of asset management, efficiency and clarity are paramount. Shelf, the [open-source asset management platform](https://github.com/Shelf-nu/shelf.nu), has long provided organizations with the tools to track [long-term custody of assets](https://www.shelf.nu/features/custody) with precision and ease. Today, we are thrilled to unveil our latest innovation – the '[Bookings](https://www.shelf.nu/features/bookings)' feature, a transformative addition that reshapes how assets are reserved and managed for short-term use.

### **The Inspiration Behind 'Bookings'**

Our journey began with a simple insight: asset managers needed a more streamlined way to handle short-term asset reservations and bookings. Prior to 'Bookings', Shelf excelled at tracking which team member had custody of long-term assets, such as assigning a laptop to a specific individual. However, the need for a system that could handle temporary asset allocation, such as loaning out equipment for events or projects, was clear.

### **What 'Bookings' Solves**

'Bookings' offers a comprehensive solution that allows asset managers and self-service users to reserve a group of assets for future dates, ensuring that every piece of equipment is used to its full potential without the risk of double-booking. This feature is not just about booking; it's about ensuring the right asset is available at the right time for the right person. Here's how it works:

**Asset Availability Check**: Before making a reservation, Shelf checks if the assets are already booked or available for the requested date and time.

*Fill in all details to check available assets for those exact dates*

**Notification System**: When a booking is requested, asset managers receive an email notification with all the details, including the booking period and the items requested.

**Reservation & Check-Out Confirmation**: On the date of the booking, the manager can mark assets as checked out in Shelf, and users receive confirmation.

**Reminders**: Users get reminders to return the assets, fostering responsibility and punctuality.

### **Real-World Applications**

The 'Bookings' feature is versatile, serving numerous scenarios:

- **Marketing Departments**: Reserve promotional materials for events and ensure their timely return.
- **Creative Agencies**: Book gear for video productions, maximizing asset utilization.
- **Educational Institutions**: Enable students to loan gear for academic projects, fostering a culture of shared resources.

### **Streamlined User Experience**

With an intuitive UI, Shelf's 'Bookings' allows users to:

- View assets' availability status at a glance.
- Employ advanced search and sorting capabilities for bookings.
- Assign custodians for accountability.

### **New user types**

In addition to our 'Admin' and 'Non registered member' user type, we now have introduced the 'Self Service' user type. This is a user type which is created in order to allow for doing booking reservation requests. Self service users can only see limited areas of the application and cannot perform a checkout. They can only request a reservation of items for an asset manager to check out and check in.

### **The Path Ahead**

As stated by our CEO, "At Shelf, we are committed to solving asset-related issues with technology and automations. We heard from hundreds of users that the batch checkout and reminders related to our bookings will save them hundreds of hours a year managing their assets. We are excited to be launching this feature to all of our users on the 'Team' plan."
