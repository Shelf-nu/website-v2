At Shelf, we're often asked why we don't offer native mobile apps. Today, I want to address this question and share our philosophy on delivering value to our users.

## Speed, Innovation, and Accessibility: The Shelf Approach

At the core of Shelf's mission is a commitment to rapid value delivery without compromising usability. We optimize for speed of innovation and delivery, aiming to build a robust system using only freely open and widely supported web standards. This approach led us to embrace Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) instead of developing native apps.

### The Beauty of Progressive Web Applications

PWAs offer a native-like experience without the overhead of maintaining separate codebases for different platforms. This allows us to focus our resources on delivering features and improvements faster, rather than splitting our efforts across multiple app stores and approval processes.

### Here's why we believe PWAs are the future:

- Universal Accessibility: On any device with a browser, you can access Shelf with full functionality - whether you're on desktop or mobile.
- App-Like Experience: By adding Shelf to your home screen, you get a distraction-free, full-screen experience that mimics a native app.
- Always Up-to-Date: No need to worry about app updates or version incompatibilities. You always have the latest version at your fingertips.
- Reduced Friction: In a world where seamless access to your asset database is crucial, PWAs eliminate excuses like "the app was broken" or "I had an old version without that functionality."
- Hardware Compatibility: Modern PWAs can tap into device features like cameras, enabling you to scan asset tags directly from your browser.

### Our Commitment to Open Standards

We believe the web should be open and accessible. PWAs align perfectly with this philosophy, ensuring that Shelf remains platform-agnostic and widely available.

## A Strong Belief, Loosely Held

While we're confident in our PWA approach, we're always open to evolving our technology stack. If future needs require deeper hardware integration or specific native functionalities that significantly enhance the Shelf experience, we'll certainly consider developing native apps. For now, we're fully committed to delivering an exceptional PWA experience.

### Try It Yourself

We encourage you to experience the power of Shelf's PWA firsthand. Simply tap 'Add to Home Screen' on your mobile device, and you'll see why we're so enthusiastic about this approach.

### Thank You for Your Trust

We're grateful for the opportunity to build solutions that address the practical challenges in your daily operations. By choosing PWAs, we ensure that you always have the latest version of Shelf at your fingertips, ready to streamline your asset management workflows.

Thank you for reading, and for being part of the Shelf community. We're excited to continue innovating and delivering value through the power of progressive web technologies.
