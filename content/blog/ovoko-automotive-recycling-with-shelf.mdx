## **Ovoko: Pioneering a Sustainable Future in Automotive Recycling with Shelf**

### **Redefining the Automotive Recycling Industry**

Ovoko stands at the forefront of automotive recycling, championing the cause of reusing and breathing new life into used car parts. With a mission to accelerate the transition to reusing, Ovoko is not just a business; it's a movement towards a circular economy in the automotive sector.

### **Company Background: From Humble Beginnings to a Pan-European Impact**

Founded in 2016 in a small town in Lithuania, Ovoko started its journey on a simple Excel file. Today, it has grown exponentially, connecting millions of used parts with satisfied buyers across Europe. Ovoko's marketplaces, rrr.lt and ovoko.pl, are more than just platforms; they are catalysts for change in the industry.

### **The Pre-Shelf Era: Navigating a Maze of Inefficiencies**

Before embracing Shelf, Ovoko's asset management was similar to navigating through a labyrinth. Key challenges included:

- **Asset Mismanagement**: Difficulty in tracking and locating equipment led to operational delays and inefficiencies.
- **Custodial Confusion**: Without a clear system, the responsibility and accountability for assets were blurred, impacting workflow.
- **Dependence on Outdated Methods**: Reliance on manual tracking methods like Excel sheets compounded these challenges, making scalability a distant dream.

### **Implementation and Adoption of Shelf**

- **Seamless Transition**: The introduction of Shelf was smooth and user-friendly, enabling quick adoption across Ovoko.
- **Customized Tracking**: Shelf's QR code system changed how Ovoko tracked and managed its assets, particularly in tracking specific items crucial to their operations. Goodbye Excel sheets.

### **Post-Implementation Transformation: A Quantitative and Qualitative Leap**

The impact of Shelf on Ovoko's operations was immediate:

- **Operational Efficiency**: The time and effort required in managing assets were drastically reduced.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Access to real-time data enabled better decision-making and resource allocation.
- **Enhanced Accountability**: The system's custodian feature fostered a culture of responsibility and accountability.

### **Ovoko's Endorsement: A Resounding Success Story**

Ovoko's journey with Shelf is not just about better asset management; it's about embracing innovation to drive sustainability and growth. Their advice to others is clear: moving to advanced systems like Shelf is crucial for staying ahead in today's fast-paced, technology-driven world.

Carlos Virreira, CEO of Shelf, reflects on the partnership: "Our collaboration with Ovoko has been incredibly inspiring. We're deeply impressed by the breadth and scale of their operations across Europe. Looking ahead, we're excited to unveil new features that will further enhance their asset management capabilities. The upcoming 'Signed Checkouts' feature, in particular, is something we believe will significantly benefit Ovoko's operations, encouraging a more comprehensive tracking of assets on Shelf. This is a development we eagerly anticipate."
