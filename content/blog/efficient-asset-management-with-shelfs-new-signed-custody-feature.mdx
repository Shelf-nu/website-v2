In the dynamic environment of asset management, accountability and flexibility are important. Shelf introduces an innovative solution that simplifies the dispatching process for company assets while ensuring compliance and transparency: the “Signed Custody” feature.

## How It Works

When an asset manager needs to assign a company asset to a team member for long-term use, the process is now streamlined with Shelf's system. Here’s how:

- **Selection**: The asset manager selects the asset within Shelf’s system and chooses a custodian from the team members.

- **Template Addition**: The manager has the option to add a PDF template, which can be any document relevant to the asset's custody—be it a responsibility agreement, a terms-of-use policy, or any other pertinent file.

- **Signature Requirement**: Before the asset is officially assigned, the selected custodian is prompted to sign the attached document. Shelf renders the PDF and provides a checkbox for the user to acknowledge and leave their signature.

‍

## Why It’s Necessary

The “Signed Custody” feature addresses several critical needs:

- **Accountability**: It ensures that both the asset manager and the custodian are aware of and agree to the terms of the asset’s use.
- **Legal Compliance**: The signature requirement adds a layer of legal compliance, as signed documents are often required for internal audits or regulatory purposes.
- **Record Keeping**: The system automatically retains records of all signed agreements, simplifying record keeping and retrieval.

## When to Use the Feature

This feature is particularly useful when:

- Assets are of **high value** or **sensitive nature** and require formal acknowledgment of custody.
- There’s a need for clear terms of use and responsibilities to be communicated and agreed upon.
- The company requires a legal trail for the asset's custody history.

## Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Administrators can upload any type of PDF document to serve as a template.
- **Ease of Use**: Shelf’s interface makes it simple for managers and custodians to complete the process without extensive training.
- **Traceability**: With the signed document, the asset's custody chain remains transparent and traceable.

## Feature Statuses

With the “Signed Custody” feature, assets will have statuses to inform all team members of their availability:

- **Waiting for Signature**: The asset is available, but flagged to show it’s pending a signature.

- **Signed and In Custody**: Once signed, the asset becomes unavailable for booking, indicating it’s under the long-term custody of an individual.

‍

Switch to non-signed custody? The process can be reset by releasing custody, removing the need for a signature, and making the asset available again.

## Conclusion

The “Signed Custody” feature by Shelf brings a new level of efficiency and security to asset management. By integrating a simple signature process, it enables organizations to maintain control over their assets with greater ease and assurance.
