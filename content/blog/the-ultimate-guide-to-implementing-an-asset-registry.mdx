# The Ultimate Guide to Implementing an Asset Registry

{/*  LONG-FORM CONTENT GOES HERE */}

---

## 1. What Is an Asset Registry?

An asset registry is the **single source of truth** for everything an organization owns.

It typically includes:
- identification details  
- status  
- location  
- responsible person (custody)  
- maintenance or usage history  
- notes and attachments  

A strong registry improves planning, accountability, and operational clarity.

## 2. Why Organizations Struggle With Asset Registries

Common issues:
- spreadsheets drifting out of sync  
- no consistent naming or tagging  
- unclear ownership  
- missing updates  
- poor visibility across teams  

Shelf was built to address these exact challenges.

## 3. Define What Belongs in Your Registry

Decide which items should be tracked:
- asset types  
- levels of granularity  
- accessories vs kits  

See: [Kits](/features/kits)

## 4. Establish Required Data Fields

Typical fields include:
- asset name  
- category  
- location  
- custodian  
- status  
- serial number or tag ID  
- acquisition date

A registry must stay current. Key workflows:
- check-in/check-out  
- custody updates  
- location changes  
- maintenance logging

See: [Asset Reminders](/features/asset-reminders)

Import and normalize data to prevent inconsistencies.

## 8. Roll Out the Registry Across Teams

Tips for adoption:
- keep workflows simple  
- avoid overconfiguration  
- provide real-use training  

See: [Workspaces](/features/workspaces)

## 9. Maintain the Registry Over Time

A good registry evolves:
- periodic reviews  
- asset archiving  
- audit preparation  
- return enforcement  

---

## 10. Common Mistakes

Avoid:
- overcomplex schemas  
- manual-only processes
