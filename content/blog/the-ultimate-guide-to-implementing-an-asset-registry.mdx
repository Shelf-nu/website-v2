## How to create an asset registry system

Managing assets is crucial for businesses to run smoothly. An asset registry is a central database that keeps track of a company's assets.

In this guide, we'll explore the benefits, challenges, and best practices of setting up an asset registry, and how Shelf can help.

### Benefits of an Asset Registry

An asset registry has many benefits, including:

**Improved Asset Tracking:** A central database keeps accurate and up-to-date information about your assets, making it easy to track and manage them. Shelf's powerful search feature helps you find specific assets and their details. Scanning a Shelf QR asset tag also shows information about each asset.

**Better Decision-Making:** With detailed asset information, you can make better decisions about maintenance, upgrades, and resource use. Shelf's custom fields and category mapping allow you to create your own logic based on how your business operates and the sort of assets it use.s

**Cost Savings:** An asset registry helps find underused or extra assets, letting you optimize resources and reduce waste. By tracking asset locations, check-outs, and bookings, Shelf prevents asset duplication and ensures efficient resource use.

**Compliance and Risk Management: **A complete asset registry ensures compliance with regulatory requirements and helps reduce risks associated with asset ownership. Shelf's audit trail feature records all asset transactions, ensuring transparency and accountability. Shelf is often used for ISO 27001 certifications.
