## What is Asset Retirement and Disposal Management?

Asset retirement and disposal management (ARDM) is the process of securely disposing of physical assets and related data. This process involves tracking, monitoring, and disposing of physical assets in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. ARDM also includes the disposal of related data, such as customer information and financial records.

ARDM is essential for ensuring the proper disposal of physical assets and reducing liability. When physical assets are retired or disposed of, organizations must ensure that the data associated with the asset is also properly removed. This helps protect the organization from potential liability and ensures the security of customer data.
