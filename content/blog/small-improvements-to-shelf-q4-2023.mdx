Small improvements we do to shelf, quarter per quarter. Not part of official big releases but gradual improvements.

Thanks for checking this blog. Here we keep a 'notepad' of small usability improvements we are doing to Shelf's user interface. 

### ‍**
Interface upgrades**

**‍**As shelf is growing and more features are being added (asset bookings, alerts) we find ourselves needing more efficient layout usage of our application. This inspired an upgrade of the UI, starting with tables, headers and action buttons.

### **Custom fields**

**‍**For both single line text and multi line text. Any links we find we will treat them as links and open them on a new tab.

*Use this to direct your users to external files with information*

‍

### **Database value calculation**

Your dashboard now shows the cumulative value of all your assets combined.

*We also calculate how many assets have filled value fields*
