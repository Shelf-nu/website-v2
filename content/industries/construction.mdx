# Tool & Equipment Tracking for Construction Teams

Construction crews rely on tools, vehicles, and equipment that move across job sites daily. Power tools, safety gear, testing equipment, and specialty items travel between trucks, storage areas, and active sites—often with little visibility into who has what.

Traditional inventory systems are too slow or too rigid for field use. Shelf provides fast, mobile-friendly workflows designed for real-world job sites where crews need to check tools in and out without delays.

## Common Challenges in Construction

Construction teams face recurring equipment management problems:

- **Tools disappearing**: Items go missing between crews, vehicles, and job sites.
- **Unclear responsibility**: No one knows who had the equipment last.
- **No visibility into location**: Tools end up at the wrong site without anyone knowing.
- **Missing accessories**: Batteries, bits, chargers, and PPE components get separated.
- **Outdated tracking systems**: Spreadsheets drift out of sync and fail under field conditions.
- **Slow software**: Complex systems that don't work well on mobile devices.

## How Shelf Supports Construction Workflows

### Clear Custody for Crews & Technicians

Shelf assigns responsibility automatically when tools are checked out. It supports daily hand-offs between crews, shift changes, and site transfers—with a complete audit trail.

See: [Custody](/features/custody)

---

### Track Tools Across Job Sites & Vehicles

Fast QR scans update location instantly. Supervisors see where tools last were, which truck they're on, and which site they're assigned to.

See: [Location Tracking](/features/location-tracking)

---

### Manage Tool Kits & Equipment Bundles

Track related items together:

- Drill + batteries + bits
- PPE kits with all components
- Testing equipment with accessories

Shelf flags missing components during check-in so nothing gets left behind.
