# Construction

Construction and field operations rely on tools and equipment that move constantly between job sites, trucks, storage areas, and field crews. Without a clear tracking system, items get misplaced, accountability breaks down, and projects slow.

Shelf provides a workflow-first approach to tool and equipment tracking, built for the reality of field operations.

## Challenges in Construction Equipment Management

Construction teams typically deal with:

- missing or misplaced tools  
- equipment left behind on job sites  
- unclear responsibility across crews  
- difficulty preparing for inspections  
- manual spreadsheets that quickly fall apart  
- unplanned downtime due to missing gear  

Shelf helps field teams stay organized and accountable.
