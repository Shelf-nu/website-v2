# IT & Technology

Modern IT teams manage a wide range of equipment — laptops, tablets, chargers, monitors, peripherals, and temporary loaner devices. These assets move frequently between employees, departments, and service cycles.

Shelf gives IT teams a clear, centralized system for tracking device assignments, history, and availability while reducing manual coordination.

---

## Challenges in IT Asset Management

IT teams often struggle with:

- unclear device ownership  
- inconsistent check-out/check-in processes  
- missing chargers or accessories  
- difficult onboarding & offboarding  
- unreliable spreadsheets or outdated systems  
- low visibility into device history  
- compliance requirements for audits  

Shelf replaces fragmented processes with clean, accountable workflows.
