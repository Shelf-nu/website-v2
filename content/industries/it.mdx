# Equipment Tracking for IT & Technology Teams

IT teams manage a constant flow of devices: laptops, chargers, peripherals, carts, cameras, VR sets, and more. Equipment moves between employees, departments, classrooms, and storage—often with little visibility into who has what.

Traditional asset systems are often too rigid or too slow for daily equipment movement. Shelf provides fast, intuitive workflows built for loaner programs and shared equipment environments where speed and accountability matter.

## Common Challenges for IT Teams

IT departments face recurring equipment management problems:

- **Unclear device ownership**: No one knows who has which laptop or peripheral.
- **Loaner laptops not returned**: Devices stay out longer than expected without follow-up.
- **Missing accessories**: Chargers, adapters, and cables disappear from kits.
- **Scattered tracking systems**: Asset info lives in spreadsheets, ticket comments, or shared docs.
- **Multi-location confusion**: Devices move between offices and storage rooms without updates.
- **No reservation system**: Staff can't reserve equipment in advance, creating conflicts.

## How Shelf Supports IT Equipment Workflows

### Custody Tracking for Loaner Devices

### Track Devices Across Rooms, Offices & Storage

Shelf supports multi-site visibility with scan-based location updates. Know where every device is—whether it's in a storage closet, a classroom, or a remote office.

### Manage Kits & Peripheral Bundles

Track related items together:

- VR kit + controllers
- Camera + SD cards + case

Shelf flags missing components during check-in so nothing gets left behind.
