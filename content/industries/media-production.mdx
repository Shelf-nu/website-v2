# Equipment Tracking for Media & Production Teams

Media programs and production teams rely on high-value equipment that moves constantly—cameras, lenses, lighting rigs, audio kits, and accessories worth tens of thousands of dollars.

Gear is shared across students, assistants, crews, and different productions. Without clear workflows, things disappear, schedules conflict, and accountability breaks down. Shelf provides simple, reliable workflows that keep equipment organized and available when productions need it.

## Common Challenges in Media Environments

Production teams face recurring equipment management problems:

- **Missing accessories**: Batteries, microphones, SD cards, and cables disappear from kits without anyone noticing.
- **Double-booked cameras or kits**: Multiple shoots get scheduled with the same gear, discovered too late.
- **Unclear responsibility**: When gear is damaged or lost, no one knows who had it last.
- **High turnover**: Students and crew members rotate constantly, requiring ongoing retraining.
- **Scattered calendars and check-out sheets**: Manual systems drift out of sync and fail before major productions.
