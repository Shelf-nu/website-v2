# Media Production

Production teams rely on complex equipment setups — cameras, lenses, lighting kits, audio gear, stands, batteries, cables, and accessories. When equipment is shared across sets, studios, and crews, things become difficult to track and even harder to manage.

Shelf gives media teams a modern system for organizing, tracking, and scheduling production equipment so shoots run smoothly.

## Challenges in Media & Production Workflows

Media teams typically face:

- lost or misplaced accessories  
- double-booked kits  
- unclear ownership during shoots  
- rushed check-outs and check-ins  
- inconsistent return conditions  
- manual spreadsheets that never stay accurate  

When equipment becomes unreliable, production slows and costs increase.
