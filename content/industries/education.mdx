# Education

Schools and universities manage thousands of shared assets — cameras, lab tools, laptops, AV gear, instruments, and classroom equipment. With constant student turnover and high demand, traditional systems quickly break down.

Shelf helps academic institutions streamline equipment management with clear workflows for bookings, check-outs, custody, and returns.

## Challenges in Educational Environments

Educational teams often struggle with:

- double-booked resources  
- missing accessories  
- unclear ownership  
- inconsistent return workflows  
- outdated spreadsheets or legacy systems  
- difficulty preparing for accreditation audits  

These issues disrupt learning and put pressure on staff.
