# Equipment Tracking for Education

Schools and universities manage a wide range of shared assets—cameras, laptops, AV gear, lab instruments, and specialized equipment that moves constantly between students, staff, and departments.

Students, teaching assistants, and rotating staff need a system that works immediately, with minimal training. Shelf provides fast, QR-first workflows designed for high-turnover environments where simplicity matters as much as accountability.

## Common Challenges in Education

Educational institutions face unique equipment management problems:

- **Equipment disappearing without ownership trails**: Gear goes missing and no one knows who had it last.
- **Double-booked resources**: Cameras, projectors, and lab equipment get reserved by multiple classes or productions.
- **Accessories missing from kits**: Batteries, cables, and adapters get separated from their parent items.
- **Rotating student workers**: New assistants each semester mean constant retraining on complex systems.
- **Outdated tracking systems**: Paper sign-out sheets and scattered spreadsheets fail under real usage.
