# Educational Resource Management

Educational resource management software helps schools, universities, and academic programs track shared equipment across departments, labs, and student workflows.

---

## What Is Educational Resource Management?

Educational resource management is the practice of organizing, scheduling, and tracking shared equipment across academic departments. It covers cameras, laptops, AV gear, lab instruments, maker tools, and any resources that move between students, faculty, and staff.

Modern resource management goes beyond static inventories. It supports multi-department workflows: students booking cameras for film projects, IT managing laptop loaners, engineering labs tracking specialized instruments, and media programs handling AV equipment—all from one centralized system.

---

## Why Schools Need Modern Resource Management

Academic institutions face unique challenges with shared equipment:

- **Lost student gear**: Equipment disappears without clear responsibility trails.
- **Departmental silos**: Each program tracks resources separately, creating duplication and confusion.
- **Paper sign-out sheets**: Manual forms get lost, damaged, or ignored.
- **No accountability**: When equipment changes hands, responsibility becomes unclear.
- **Schedule conflicts**: Students and faculty compete for the same gear without visibility.

Modern resource management solves these problems with unified workflows, automatic custody tracking, and conflict-free scheduling.

## How Shelf Supports Education

### Bookings

Students and staff reserve equipment ahead of time. Shelf's booking system shows real-time availability, prevents double-bookings, and lets users plan projects with confidence.

See: [Bookings](/features/bookings)

---

### QR Check-In/Out

Users scan a QR code to check equipment in or out. It takes seconds, works on any phone, and requires no training. Students adopt it immediately; staff save time.

---

### Custody Chain

Shelf logs who has each piece of equipment and when it changed hands. When gear transfers between students or returns to the equipment cage, the system updates instantly—providing a complete responsibility trail.

See: [Custody](/features/custody)

---

### Kits

Bundle cameras with lenses, laptops with chargers, and lab instruments with accessories. Shelf tracks what belongs together and flags missing components during check-in.

See: [Kits](/features/kits)

---

### Workspaces for Departments

Separate inventories by department, program, or campus. Each workspace manages its own equipment and users while administrators retain oversight across the institution.

See: [Workspaces](/features/workspaces)
