# Educational Resource Management

Schools and universities rely on thousands of shared resources — cameras, lighting kits, laptops, lab tools, projectors, AV devices, and classroom equipment. When these resources are distributed across students, staff, and different buildings, visibility disappears and workflows break down.

Shelf helps academic institutions centralize equipment management with clean, modern workflows for bookings, custody, location tracking, and returns.

---

## Why Educational Resource Management Matters

Education environments face unique challenges:

- high student turnover  
- multiple departments sharing resources  
- frequent bookings for classes, labs, and productions  
- accessories that easily go missing  
- incomplete returns  
- limited staff available to manage equipment  

Shelf simplifies these workflows so staff can focus on teaching — not chasing gear.

---

## Common Problems in Schools & Universities

Without a proper system, institutions typically face:

- double-booked equipment  
- missing items or incomplete kits  
- unclear ownership  
- inefficient checkouts  
- no visibility across labs or buildings  
- inconsistent return processes  
- difficulty preparing for accreditation audits  

These issues create friction for both staff and students.

## Workflow Example

A typical education workflow:

1. Student or staff member books a camera kit or lab tool.  
2. Staff prepare the kit or approve the reservation.  
3. Student scans the QR label → custody assigned.  
4. Throughout the project → reminders ensure timely return.  
5. Student returns equipment → missing accessories flagged instantly.  
6. Item becomes available for the next user.  

This workflow is used by some of the best media, theatre, and engineering programs globally.

## Shelf vs Traditional Lab Managers

Most lab management systems:

- were built 10+ years ago  
- are clunky and slow  
- don’t track custody  
- don’t support kits  
- weren’t built for AV or creative programs  

Shelf brings a **modern, workflow-first alternative**.

## Real Use Cases

- Film schools issuing cameras & lenses  
- AV departments managing lighting and audio gear  
- Science labs checking out field kits  
- Engineering programs managing shared tools  
- Makerspaces organizing student equipment
