# IT Asset Tracking

IT asset tracking is the practice of managing the lifecycle, location, and responsibility of devices across your organization—from laptops and tablets to chargers, monitors, and peripherals.

---

## What Is IT Asset Tracking?

IT asset tracking covers the full lifecycle of devices: procurement, deployment, assignment, usage, maintenance, and eventual retirement or replacement. It provides visibility into who has what, where devices are located, when they're due for return, and whether they need service.

Modern IT asset tracking goes beyond static inventory lists. It supports dynamic workflows like loaner programs, hybrid-workforce device assignments, onboarding/offboarding handoffs, and multi-location visibility—all from a centralized system.

## Why Teams Need a Modern IT Asset Tracking Solution

IT departments face persistent challenges with device management:

- **Missing devices**: Laptops, chargers, and peripherals disappear without clear trails.
- **No ownership history**: When devices change hands, responsibility becomes unclear.
- **Outdated spreadsheets**: Manual records drift out of sync and fail under real operational pressure.
- **Hybrid work complexity**: Remote employees, rotating offices, and distributed teams make visibility harder.
- **Disconnected systems**: Reservations, custody, and maintenance live in separate tools—or don't exist at all.

A modern IT asset tracking solution consolidates these workflows into a single, intuitive platform that fits how IT teams actually work.

## How Shelf Supports IT Asset Tracking

### QR-First Identification

Every device gets a QR code. Scanning instantly shows device details, custody history, booking status, and maintenance notes. No training required—anyone with a phone can check or update an asset in seconds.

---

### Bookings for Loaners

IT loaner programs need conflict-free scheduling. Shelf prevents double-bookings, shows real-time availability, and lets users reserve devices ahead of time.

See: [Bookings](/features/bookings)

---

### Custody Tracking

Shelf automatically logs who has each device and when it was assigned. When an employee returns a laptop or hands off a charger, the system updates instantly—providing a complete responsibility trail.

See: [Custody](/features/custody)

---

### Locations for Offices / Rooms

Track devices across buildings, floors, rooms, and storage areas. When equipment moves, update the location with a quick scan. Ideal for classroom tech, meeting room setups, and multi-site IT operations.

See: [Location Tracking](/features/location-tracking)

---

### Kits for Accessories

Group chargers, adapters, cables, and peripherals with their parent devices. Shelf flags missing components and keeps kits together so nothing gets left behind.

See: [Kits](/features/kits)

---

### Workspaces

Separate IT inventories by department, campus, or team. Each workspace operates independently with its own users, permissions, and assets—while admins retain central oversight.
