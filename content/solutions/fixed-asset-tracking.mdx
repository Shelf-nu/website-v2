# Fixed Asset Tracking

Fixed asset tracking software helps organizations monitor high-value equipment across locations, departments, and lifecycle stages—from acquisition to retirement.

## What Is Fixed Asset Tracking?

Fixed asset tracking is the practice of monitoring long-term, high-value assets that an organization owns and uses over time. These include machinery, vehicles, IT infrastructure, furniture, specialized equipment, and any items that appear on a balance sheet.

Organizations track fixed assets to maintain accurate records, support audits, plan maintenance, manage depreciation, and ensure accountability. Modern fixed asset tracking replaces spreadsheets and manual inventories with real-time visibility and automated workflows.

## Why Teams Need Modern Fixed Asset Tracking

Organizations face persistent challenges with fixed asset management:

- **Outdated spreadsheets**: Manual records drift out of sync and fail during audits.
- **No accountability**: When assets change hands or locations, responsibility becomes unclear.
- **Location ambiguity**: No one knows where high-value equipment actually sits.
- **Depreciation ignored**: Lifecycle data isn't captured or maintained consistently.
- **Lack of usage visibility**: Decisions about replacement or reallocation happen without data.

Modern fixed asset tracking solves these problems with QR identification, automatic custody logs, and centralized visibility across the organization.

### QR Identification

Every asset gets a QR code. Scan to instantly view details, custody history, location, and service status. Fast, accurate, and works on any device.

---

### Custody Chain

Shelf logs who is responsible for each asset and when responsibility changed. Transfers update automatically—providing a complete audit trail.

See: [Custody](/features/custody)

---

### Locations

Track assets across buildings, floors, rooms, and storage areas. When equipment moves, update the location with a quick scan.

See: [Location Tracking](/features/location-tracking)
