# Fixed Asset Tracking

Fixed assets are some of the most valuable items an organization owns — cameras, vehicles, AV equipment, lab tools, machinery, laptops, carts, and more. But without consistent tracking, assets go missing, depreciation schedules fall behind, and audits become stressful.

Shelf gives organizations a modern, QR-first system to track fixed assets across their entire lifecycle.

## What Are Fixed Assets?

Fixed assets are long-term, high-value items that support daily operations, including:

- production equipment  
- AV and media equipment  
- IT devices and carts  
- lab and research tools  
- field equipment  
- vehicles & machinery  

Unlike consumables, fixed assets require:

- precise tracking  
- maintenance  
- periodic valuation  
- custody visibility  
- audit readiness  

Shelf simplifies all of this without the complexity of traditional fixed asset systems.

## Problems With Traditional Fixed Asset Management

Organizations often struggle with:

- spreadsheets that become outdated instantly  
- incomplete depreciation schedules  
- missing equipment  
- unclear ownership  
- manual audit preparation  
- scattered documentation  

These issues create financial risk and operational inefficiencies.
