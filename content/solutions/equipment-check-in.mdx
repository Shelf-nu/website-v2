# Equipment Check-In / Check-Out

Shared equipment only works when everyone knows what is available, who has what, and when it is coming back. Shelf replaces manual sign-out sheets, sticky notes, and spreadsheets with a streamlined digital workflow — scan a QR code, transfer custody, and move on.

---

## The Problem with Manual Check-Out

Organizations that rely on manual processes for equipment lending face the same issues:

- **Sticky notes and whiteboards**: Sign-out records get erased, lost, or ignored. There is no reliable trail of who took what.
- **Spreadsheets**: Manual tracking drifts out of sync as soon as more than one person is involved. Version conflicts and stale data are the norm.
- **No accountability**: Without a structured system, there is no way to prove who was responsible for a missing or damaged item.
- **Delayed returns**: No one notices late returns until the next person needs the equipment and finds it gone.
- **No visibility across locations**: Multi-site teams have no way to see what is available at other facilities.

## How Shelf Streamlines Check-In/Out

### QR Scanning

Every asset gets a printable QR label. Users scan the code with any phone camera to check an item in or out. No app download, no training, no special hardware. The process takes seconds.

---

### Custody Transfer

When equipment is checked out, Shelf automatically records who has it, when they took it, and when it is due back. When they return it, a second scan completes the cycle. The full custody chain is logged and searchable.

---

### Booking Integration

Check-out works hand in hand with bookings. Users can reserve equipment in advance, then scan to confirm the pick-up when the reservation begins. This prevents conflicts and keeps the schedule honest.

### Multi-Location Support

Track equipment across buildings, campuses, warehouses, and field sites. Each location maintains its own inventory while sharing visibility across the organization.

See: [Location Tracking](/features/location-tracking)

---

## Key Features

- **Bookings**: Reserve equipment ahead of time with conflict-free scheduling.
- **Custody**: Automatic logging of who has each item and when it changed hands.
- **Kits**: Bundle related items together so accessories check out with their parent asset.
- **Location Tracking**: Know where equipment is across multiple sites.
- **User Roles**: Control who can check out, who can approve, and who can manage inventory.

---

## Common Use Cases

- **AV equipment**: Media teams and education programs check out cameras, microphones, and lighting for productions and classes.
- **IT devices**: Helpdesks manage loaner laptops, monitors, and peripherals with clear accountability.
- **Construction tools**: Site managers issue power tools and safety equipment to crews at the start of each shift.
- **Lab gear**: Researchers check out instruments and testing equipment with documented custody trails.
