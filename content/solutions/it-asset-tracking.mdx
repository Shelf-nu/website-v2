# IT Asset Tracking

IT teams manage a constant flow of devices — laptops, tablets, chargers, cameras, carts, and accessories. Between onboarding, offboarding, remote workers, and equipment rotation, assets can disappear or become difficult to track.

Shelf gives IT teams a clean, modern system to track devices, manage custody, and simplify handoffs without the overhead of traditional ITAM platforms.

---

## What Is IT Asset Tracking?

IT asset tracking covers every stage of a device’s lifecycle:

- onboarding assignments  
- daily use & transfers  
- maintenance and updates  
- offboarding & returns  
- redeployment or retirement  

Shelf helps teams maintain visibility and accountability from the moment a device is issued until the moment it’s retired.

## Problems With Traditional IT Tracking

Most IT teams still rely on:

- spreadsheets  
- ad-hoc notes  
- outdated inventory tools  
- inconsistent handoff processes  

This leads to:

- laptops disappearing during offboarding  
- chargers, adapters, and peripherals becoming “ghost assets”  
- audit difficulties  
- lost accessories  
- unclear ownership  
- time-consuming manual updates  

These inefficiencies grow with team size and turnover.

A reliable process that reduces losses.

### Full Lifecycle History

## Workflow Example

A typical IT workflow with Shelf:

1. IT prepares a device kit and assigns custody to a new hire.  
2. Device moves between staff or teams → every change is logged.  
3. Maintenance reminders notify IT before issues occur.  
4. Offboarding → user scans and returns all items in the kit.  
5. IT refurbishes device → reassigns for the next hire.  

This ensures accountability throughout the entire lifecycle.
