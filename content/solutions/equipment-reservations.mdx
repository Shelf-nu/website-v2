# Equipment Reservations

Shared equipment needs structure, especially in environments like film schools, AV departments, labs, and production studios. Without a clean reservation system, people guess, calendars conflict, items disappear, and staff waste time resolving scheduling issues.

Shelf gives teams a modern reservation workflow that prevents double-bookings and makes equipment scheduling effortless.

---

## Why Equipment Reservations Matter

Teams rely on predictable access to:

- camera kits  
- lighting equipment  
- lab gear  
- AV equipment  
- tool bags  
- specialty instruments  

When reservations fail, entire projects are delayed.

Shelf ensures that equipment is always available when needed — and never double-booked.

## Problems With Traditional Reservation Systems

Most reservation workflows rely on:

- Google Sheets  
- paper calendars  
- outdated lab systems  
- manual sign-up sheets  

These break down because:

- people book the same item simultaneously  
- reservations are unclear or not enforced  
- items aren’t ready when students or staff arrive  
- accessories go missing  
- no history exists for what happened  

Shelf fixes this by connecting reservations directly to asset profiles, custody, and availability.

- [Bookings](/features/bookings)

### Integrated Check-In / Check-Out
Reservations automatically transition into custody workflows.

### Kits for Complex Setups
Bundle cameras, lenses, lights, and accessories into a single reservation.

### Reminders & Notifications
Help users return gear on time.

---

## Workflow Example

A typical equipment reservation workflow:

1. User finds an available item or kit.  
2. They reserve it for a time window.  
3. Staff prepare the equipment (or auto-approve).  
4. User arrives → scan → custody assigned.  
5. After use → scan → returned → accessories verified.  
6. Item becomes instantly available again.  

This workflow works beautifully for academic departments, media teams, and production studios.

## Shelf vs Alternative Systems

Older reservation systems:

- are not connected to asset metadata  
- do not track custody  
- do not track accessories  
- still allow conflicts  

Shelf unifies everything into one workflow.
