# Mobile Asset Auditing

Asset audits should not require a clipboard, a desktop computer, or a dedicated app. With Shelf, teams can audit equipment from any phone or tablet — scan QR labels, verify locations, update records, and confirm asset conditions in the field. Everything syncs in real time, so the back office sees results the moment they happen.

## Why Mobile Auditing Matters

Traditional asset audits are slow, error-prone, and disruptive:

- **Field operations**: Teams working across job sites, warehouses, or campuses cannot return to a desk to update records. Data entry gets delayed or skipped entirely.
- **Multi-site organizations**: Auditing equipment spread across multiple locations requires coordination, travel, and manual consolidation of results.
- **Compliance pressure**: Regulatory bodies and insurance providers expect up-to-date records. Outdated spreadsheets do not hold up under scrutiny.
- **Manual processes**: Paper-based audits introduce transcription errors, duplicate entries, and gaps that undermine the entire exercise.

Mobile auditing eliminates these problems by putting the audit tool in every team member's pocket.

## How Shelf Enables Mobile Audits

### Works on Any Device

Shelf runs in the browser on any phone, tablet, or laptop. There is no app to install, no compatibility issues, and no training overhead. If a device has a camera and a browser, it can run an audit.

---

### QR Scanning

Each asset has a unique QR label. During an audit, the user scans the code to pull up the asset record instantly. This confirms the item's existence, identity, and current data — all in one step.

---

### GPS Updates on Scan

When a QR code is scanned, Shelf can update the asset's location automatically based on the device's GPS coordinates. This keeps location data current without requiring manual entry, which is especially valuable for equipment that moves between sites.

---

### Real-Time Sync

Every scan and update syncs immediately to the central database. Managers monitoring the audit from the office see results as they happen. There is no batch upload step, no file merging, and no risk of conflicting edits.

---

## Key Features

- **Multi-device support**: Audit from phones, tablets, or laptops without installing anything.
- **Custom fields**: Verify and update any field during the audit — condition, serial number, notes, or organization-specific data.
- **Location tracking**: Confirm or update asset locations as part of the audit workflow.
- **Dashboard reporting**: View audit progress and results from the central dashboard in real time.

---

## Common Use Cases

- **Warehouse audits**: Walk the floor with a phone, scan each item, and confirm inventory counts match records.
- **Field inspections**: Verify equipment at remote job sites, construction zones, or client locations without returning to the office.
- **Compliance checks**: Generate documented proof that assets were verified at specific times and locations for regulatory requirements.
- **Insurance documentation**: Scan and photograph assets to maintain current records for policy renewals and claims.
