# Tool Tracking

Tool tracking software helps field teams manage the location, responsibility, and movement of tools across job sites, vehicles, and crew members.

## What Is Tool Tracking?

Tool tracking is the practice of monitoring who has which tools, where they're located, and when they move between sites, trucks, or storage. It ensures accountability across crews, reduces loss, and keeps operations running smoothly.

Modern tool tracking goes beyond static lists. It supports dynamic field workflows: technicians scanning tools onto trucks, supervisors checking inventory across sites, and crews handing off equipment during shift changes—all with instant visibility.

## Why Teams Need Modern Tool Tracking

Field teams face persistent challenges with tool management:

- **Lost tools**: Equipment disappears across job sites without clear trails.
- **No responsibility tracking**: When tools change hands, accountability becomes unclear.
- **Manual sign-out sheets**: Paper forms get lost, damaged, or skipped entirely.
- **Scattered kits**: Accessories and components get separated from their parent tools.
- **Confusion on job sites**: No one knows what's available, what's missing, or who had it last.

Modern tool tracking solves these problems with QR scanning, automatic custody logs, and real-time location updates.

## How Shelf Supports Tool Tracking

![Asset index showing tool inventory and status](https://qliecghuzfchfjwaisyx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/website-images/solutions/asset-index.webp)

### QR Scanning

Every tool gets a QR code. Technicians scan to check tools in or out—no paperwork, no delays. It works on any phone, requires no training, and updates instantly.

---

### Custody Chain

Shelf logs who has each tool and when it changed hands. During shift changes, crew rotations, or site transfers, responsibility updates automatically—providing a complete trail.

See: [Custody](/features/custody)

---

### Locations for Sites & Trucks

Track tools across job sites, storage facilities, vehicles, and tool cribs. When equipment moves, update the location with a quick scan.

See: [Location Tracking](/features/location-tracking)

---

### Kits

Bundle tools with their accessories, cases, and consumables. Shelf tracks what belongs together and flags missing components during check-in.

See: [Kits](/features/kits)

---

### Reminders

Schedule maintenance alerts, inspection cycles, and calibration reminders. Keep tools safe, compliant, and ready for use.
