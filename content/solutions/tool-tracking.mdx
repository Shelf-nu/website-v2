# Tool Tracking

In field operations, tools move constantly — across job sites, trucks, shifts, and crews. Without a simple system, equipment disappears, productivity drops, and projects slow down.

Shelf gives teams a lightweight, reliable way to track tools with QR scans, custody assignments, and real-time location updates.

## What Is Tool Tracking?

Tool tracking is the practice of maintaining visibility on equipment as it moves between people and places. For field teams, this often includes:

- power tools  
- PPE  
- specialty meters  
- drones  
- shared bags or kits  

When tools aren’t where crews expect them, work stops.

## Problems With Traditional Tool Management

Field-heavy teams commonly struggle with:

- tools lost between shifts  
- no record of who last used an item  
- tools left behind at job sites  
- unsafe tools because maintenance is ignored  
- overspending on replacements  
- crews wasting time searching for gear  

These issues escalate quickly across multiple sites.

### Tool Bags & Kits
Group tools together for faster, more consistent handoffs.

### Maintenance & Calibration Reminders
Perfect for safety-critical tools that must be checked regularly.

### Dashboard Visibility
See what’s overdue, missing, or idle across all projects.

---

## Workflow Example

1. Crew lead scans a tool → custody assigned.  
2. Tool moves between sites → location updated.  
3. Dashboard shows which crew has which gear.  
4. Maintenance reminders prompt safety checks.  
5. Tools returned at end of shift → workflow completed.  

This creates a reliable, auditable history.

## Key Benefits

### Fewer Lost Tools
Clear responsibility prevents equipment from “disappearing.”

### Higher Field Productivity
Crews start work faster because they know where gear is.

### Stronger Safety & Compliance
Maintenance reminders reduce risk.

### Better Oversight
Supervisors gain real-time visibility into tool movement.
