# Home Inventory Management

Most people have no idea what they own until they need to file an insurance claim, pack for a move, or settle an estate. Shelf gives individuals and families a simple way to catalog personal belongings with QR tags, photos, location mapping, and custom fields — all accessible from any device.

## Why Track Home Inventory

Maintaining a home inventory is one of those tasks everyone knows they should do but few actually complete. The reasons to start are compelling:

- **Insurance claims**: After a fire, flood, or theft, insurance companies require a detailed list of lost or damaged items with descriptions and estimated values. Without documentation, claims are slow, disputed, or underpaid.
- **Moving**: Knowing exactly what you own, where it is packed, and which room it belongs in makes relocations dramatically more efficient.
- **Organization**: A cataloged inventory helps families keep track of valuable items, seasonal equipment, and rarely used belongings stored in attics, garages, and storage units.
- **Estate planning**: A documented inventory simplifies the process of distributing belongings and reduces conflict among family members.

## How Shelf Works for Home Use

### QR Tagging

Print small QR labels and attach them to items, storage bins, or shelves. Scan a tag with your phone to pull up the item's full record — no app required, just the phone's camera and browser.

---

### Custom Fields

Track whatever matters to you: purchase date, price paid, warranty expiration, serial number, condition, or sentimental value. Define your own fields to match the way you think about your belongings.

---

### Location Rooms

Organize assets by room, closet, garage, storage unit, or any other location. When items move, update the location with a quick scan. During a move, filter by location to see exactly what needs to come from each space.

---

### Photo Documentation

Upload photos of each item to create visual records for insurance and personal reference. Capture serial numbers, receipts, condition details, and packaging — all attached to the item's profile.

---

### Sharing

Invite family members or roommates to the same workspace so everyone can view and update the inventory. Permissions control who can add, edit, or delete records, keeping the data reliable.

---

## Benefits

- **Insurance readiness**: File faster, more accurate claims with documented proof of ownership, condition, and value.
- **Moving efficiency**: Know exactly what you own, where it is, and where it goes in the new space. No more mystery boxes.
- **Family sharing**: Multiple household members can access and contribute to the same inventory from their own devices.
- **Peace of mind**: A complete home inventory removes the guesswork from insurance, organization, and life transitions.

---

## Common Use Cases

- **Homeowners**: Catalog electronics, furniture, appliances, and valuables for insurance purposes.
- **Renters**: Document belongings covered under renter's insurance with photos and estimated values.
- **Collectors**: Track collections of art, wine, instruments, or memorabilia with custom fields for provenance and valuation.
- **Families in transition**: Inventory belongings before a move, renovation, or estate settlement.
