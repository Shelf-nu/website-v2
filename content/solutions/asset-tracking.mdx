# Asset Tracking

Modern teams rely on equipment every day — from tools and laptops to cameras, drones, and classroom gear. But when assets are tracked through memory, spreadsheets, or inconsistent processes, things go missing, projects stall, and responsibility becomes unclear.

Shelf gives organizations a simple, reliable way to track physical assets across people, locations, and time. With a QR-first workflow and clean, modern UI, anyone can learn it in minutes.

## What Is Asset Tracking?

Asset tracking is the practice of identifying equipment, assigning responsibility, and keeping visibility on where items are and how they’re used.

Teams adopt asset tracking when:
- gear frequently changes hands  
- items travel between locations  
- students, staff, or technicians share equipment  
- accountability is unclear  
- audits and compliance require accurate logs  

Shelf focuses on **workflow-based tracking** rather than rigid inventory systems — meaning it adapts to how your team actually works.

## Problems With Traditional Asset Tracking

Organizations typically struggle with asset tracking because tools don’t match their workflows.

Common issues include:
- **Lost equipment** with no ownership trail  
- **Double-booked items** due to manual calendars  
- **Outdated spreadsheets** that quickly fall apart  
- **Missing accessories** (batteries, cables, chargers)  
- **No audit trail**, creating compliance headaches  
- **Poor visibility** for managers and administrators  

These problems lead to overspending, delays, and frustration.

Shelf provides a unified system that replaces fragmented spreadsheets, calendars, and shared documents.

### QR-First Identification

## Workflow Example

A typical workflow in Shelf looks like this:

1. User scans a QR label on the equipment.  
2. The system shows availability, history, custody, and related items.  
3. User checks out the item or books it for a future time.  
4. Custody is automatically assigned.  
5. When returned, a quick scan completes the workflow.  
6. Any missing accessories or issues are flagged for review.  

This process works equally well for field technicians, students, IT teams, and creative studios.
