# Asset Tracking

Asset tracking software helps teams monitor who has what, where it is, and how it moves—providing visibility, accountability, and control over shared equipment.

## What Is Asset Tracking?

Asset tracking is the practice of monitoring equipment throughout its lifecycle: who has it, where it's located, when it moves, and what condition it's in. It applies to any organization that shares, lends, or distributes physical items—from cameras and laptops to tools and lab equipment.

Modern asset tracking replaces spreadsheets and manual logs with real-time workflows: QR scanning, automatic custody updates, conflict-free scheduling, and centralized visibility across teams and locations.

## Why Traditional Asset Tracking Fails

Organizations relying on manual methods face persistent problems:

- **Lost gear**: Equipment disappears without clear responsibility trails.
- **Spreadsheets that drift**: Manual records become outdated and unreliable.
- **Missing accessories**: Chargers, cables, and components get separated from their parent items.
- **Double bookings**: Multiple users reserve the same equipment for the same time.
- **No audit trail**: When something goes wrong, there's no history to review.

These gaps create friction, financial loss, and operational chaos. Modern asset tracking solves them with structured workflows and real-time visibility.

## How Shelf Solves Asset Tracking

![Asset index view with detailed equipment list](https://qliecghuzfchfjwaisyx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/website-images/solutions/asset-index.webp)

### QR Scanning

Every asset gets a QR code. Scan to instantly view details, check equipment in or out, update locations, or see booking status. It takes seconds and works on any device.

---

### Custody

Shelf logs who is responsible for each asset and when responsibility changed. Transfers update automatically—providing a complete trail of accountability.

See: [Custody](/features/custody)

---

### Location Tracking

Track assets across buildings, rooms, job sites, vehicles, and storage areas. When equipment moves, update the location with a quick scan.

See: [Location Tracking](/features/location-tracking)

---

### Bookings

Reserve equipment ahead of time with conflict-free scheduling. Shelf shows real-time availability and prevents double-bookings automatically.

See: [Bookings](/features/bookings)

---

### Kits

Bundle assets with their accessories, cables, and components. Shelf tracks what belongs together and flags missing items during check-in.

See: [Kits](/features/kits)

---

### Workspaces

Separate inventories by department, location, or team. Each workspace manages its own assets and users while administrators retain centralized oversight.

See: [Workspaces](/features/workspaces)
