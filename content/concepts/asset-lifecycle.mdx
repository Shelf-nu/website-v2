## The Four Stages of an Asset's Life

Every physical asset goes through four key stages:
1. **Planning & Procurement:** Deciding what to buy.
2. **Acquisition & Deployment:** Getting it into the hands of users.
3. **Maintenance & Utilization:** Keeping it running and useful.
4. **Disposal:** Selling, recycling, or trashing it.

Managing each stage effectively saves money and ensures compliance.
