## What's New

### Customizable Visibility Settings

Administrators can now configure:

- **Custody Visibility**: Choose whether Self Service and Base users can see custody information for assets not assigned to them.
- **Bookings Visibility**: Choose whether Self Service and Base users can see bookings created by other team members.

By default, Self Service and Base users can only see custody and booking information for assets where they are directly involved. With these new settings, you can create a more transparent environment where team members can see who has which assets and when they're scheduled for use.

## How It Works

The new permission settings can be found in **Settings > Workspace** under the **Permissions** section. Each permission can be toggled on or off independently, allowing for precise control over what your team members can access.

## Special Cases

This feature has been carefully designed to handle special cases:

- Users can always see custody and booking information for assets assigned to them, regardless of their role.
- When custody visibility is disabled, Self Service and Base users will see a "Private" badge instead of custodian names on asset lists.
- Without booking visibility permissions, users will only see their own bookings in the calendar and booking lists.

## Why This Matters

This update addresses feedback from many organizations that needed finer control over information sharing within their teams. Some benefits include:

- **Enhanced Privacy**: Restrict sensitive asset assignment information when needed
- **Improved Transparency**: Option to create a more open environment where everyone can see equipment status
- **Tailored Experience**: Create the perfect balance of access rights for your specific team structure

## How to Get Started

This feature is available to all Team plan customers. To configure these permissions:

1. Log in as an Administrator or Account Owner
2. Navigate to Settings > Workspace
3. Scroll to the Permissions section
4. Use the toggles to enable or disable specific permissions

## Looking Ahead

This update is part of an ongoing commitment to make Shelf more flexible and customizable for teams of all sizes. Additional permission settings are being developed to give you even more control over your workspace.
