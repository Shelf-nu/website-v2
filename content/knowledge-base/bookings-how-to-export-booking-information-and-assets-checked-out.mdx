## Introduction

Shelf's booking export feature enables you to extract comprehensive information about your bookings in CSV format. This functionality makes it easier to track equipment usage, allocate costs to projects, generate reports, and maintain accurate records of asset movements.

## How to Export Bookings

1. Navigate to the Bookings page in your Shelf workspace
2. Filter your bookings using the search bar or filter options (optional)
3. Select the bookings you want to export by:
   - Checking individual booking checkboxes
   - Using the master checkbox to select all visible bookings
4. Click the "Export selection" button in the top-right corner
5. The system will generate and download a CSV file containing your selected bookings

Select your bookings (in any state) and then click on export selection.

## What's Included in the Export

The CSV export contains the following information for each booking:

- **Booking URL**: Direct link to view the booking in Shelf
- **Booking ID**: Unique identifier for the booking
- **Name**: Title of the booking
- **Start date**: When the booking begins (check-out date)
- **End date**: When the booking ends (check-in date)
- **Custodian**: Person responsible for the assets during the booking period
- **Description**: Any notes or details about the booking
- **Assets**: List of assets included in the booking

## Practical Applications

This export functionality is particularly valuable for:

- **Financial Reporting**: Allocate equipment costs to different departments or projects
- **Usage Analysis**: Track how frequently specific assets are booked and by whom
- **Audit Preparation**: Maintain comprehensive records of equipment movements
- **Resource Planning**: Identify patterns in equipment usage to optimize your inventory
- **External System Integration**: Import booking data into other tools and systems

## Coming Soon: Reference ID Field

A future update will include the addition of a Reference ID field, which will allow you to:

- Associate bookings with specific project IDs
- Link bookings to external tracking systems
- Create custom identifiers for easier sorting and filtering
- Enable more granular tracking and reporting capabilities
