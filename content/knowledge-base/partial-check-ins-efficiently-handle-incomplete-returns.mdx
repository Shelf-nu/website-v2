## What Are Partial Check-ins?

When someone returns only some of the assets from their booking, partial check-ins let you:

- Check in available assets immediately without waiting for missing items
- Keep bookings active until all assets are returned
- Maintain accurate inventory status with context-aware asset states
- Track which assets are still outstanding with real-time progress monitoring
- Handle complex multi-booking scenarios where assets exist in multiple bookings

The system functions similarly to a library loan where you can return some books while keeping others checked out under the same loan, with intelligent tracking of each item's status across all active loans.

## How Partial Check-ins Work

### Three Ways to Perform Partial Check-ins

**Quick Check-in (Dropdown)**

- Checks in all remaining assets at once (traditional method)
- Intelligently skips assets already checked in from previous partial sessions
- Use this when all remaining assets are being returned together

**Explicit Check-in (Scanner)**

- Opens a dedicated scanner interface for selective asset check-in
- Features real-time progress tracking and booking context
- Perfect for partial returns with physical verification of each item
- Mobile-optimized with responsive progress display

**Bulk Selection (Actions Menu)**

- Select specific assets from the booking list using checkboxes
- Choose Actions > Check in to process only the selected items
- Ideal when you want to check in specific assets without scanning
- Supports both individual assets and entire kits

### Using Explicit Check-in (Scanner Method)

1. Access the scanner: Click "Explicit check-in" from the check-in dropdown
2. Smart booking context: Scanner opens with booking details and progress bar at the top
3. Scan returned assets: Use your device's camera to scan QR codes or barcodes
4. Real-time validation: System validates each scan against booking contents and prevents conflicts
5. Progress tracking: Watch the progress bar update with percentage completion
6. Auto-completion: Booking automatically completes when last asset is scanned

### Using Bulk Selection (Actions Method)

1. View the booking: Navigate to the booking detail page
2. Select assets: Check the boxes next to assets being returned
3. Access Actions menu: Click the Actions dropdown in the toolbar
4. Check in selected: Choose "Check in" from the Actions menu
5. Confirm action: The selected assets will be checked in and marked as available

**Bulk Selection Benefits:**

- No scanning required -- perfect for damaged QR codes or when scanning is not practical
- Visual confirmation of exactly which assets you are processing
- Works with both individual assets and complete kits
- Instant processing without needing to navigate to scanner interface

### Asset Status Intelligence

The system features context-aware status management that handles complex scenarios:

**Multi-booking Asset States**

- Assets can exist in multiple bookings simultaneously
- Status displays are context-aware based on which booking you are viewing
- An asset might be "Available" in one booking context but "Checked Out" in another

**Smart Status Labels**

- "Already checked in": Shows for assets that have been returned in active bookings
- "Available": Asset returned and ready for new bookings
- "Checked out": Asset currently in use in this booking context

## Best Practices

### Choosing the Right Method

**Use Explicit Check-in (Scanner) when:**

- You need physical verification of each item
- Processing returns incrementally as they arrive
- Working with mixed kit returns
- QR codes are easily scannable

**Use Bulk Selection (Actions) when:**

- QR codes are damaged or hard to scan
- You prefer working from a visual list
- Processing specific items from paperwork or notes
- Quick selection of multiple items at once

**Use Quick Check-in when:**

- All remaining assets are being returned together
- Fast processing is priority
- You have verified all items are present
