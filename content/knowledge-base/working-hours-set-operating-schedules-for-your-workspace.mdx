## Why Working Hours Matters

### The Problem It Solves

Without operational hour controls, users could reserve equipment during non-operational times -- such as 2 AM pickups when facilities open at 9 AM, weekend requests for weekday-only operations, or after-hours returns when staff is unavailable.

### Systematic Scheduling Control

Working Hours provides automatic validation respecting actual operational capacity, reducing confusion and eliminating impossible booking scenarios.

## Setting Up Working Hours

### Step 1: Enable Working Hours

1. Navigate to **Settings** in your workspace
2. Select **Working Hours** from the sidebar
3. Toggle **"Enable working hours"** to activate the feature
4. Working hours enforcement begins immediately for your workspace

### Step 2: Configure Weekly Schedule

1. Set operational hours for each day of the week
2. Use dropdown menus to select:
   - **Start time** (e.g., 9:00 AM)
   - **End time** (e.g., 5:00 PM)
3. Toggle individual days **on/off** as needed
4. Disabled days are treated as non-operational

### Step 3: Save Your Schedule

1. Review your weekly schedule configuration
2. Click **"Save Schedule"** to apply settings
3. Working hours become active and validate all new booking requests

## Managing Date Overrides

### When You Need Overrides

Date overrides modify standard schedules for specific dates:

- **Holiday closures** (Christmas, New Year's, etc.)
- **Maintenance days** (equipment servicing, facility upgrades)
- **Extended hours** (special events, extended operations)
- **Training days** (staff development, system maintenance)

### Creating Date Overrides

1. In Working Hours settings, locate **"Date overrides"**
2. Click **"Add override"** to create a new exception
3. Configure the override:
   - **Date**: Select the specific date for the override
   - **Status**: Choose "Open" (with custom hours) or "Closed" (no bookings)
   - **Operating Hours**: Set custom start/end times if status is "Open"
   - **Reason**: Add a description (e.g., "Holiday Closure", "Staff Training")
4. Click **"Create Override"** to save

### Managing Existing Overrides

- View all configured overrides in the **"Upcoming Schedule Changes"** section
- Edit or delete overrides by clicking on them in the list
- Overrides automatically appear in booking interfaces to inform users

## How Working Hours Affects Bookings

### User Experience
