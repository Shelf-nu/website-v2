## Step-by-Step Process

1. Navigate to **Settings > Team** in your workspace
2. Select the **NRM** tab to view your non-registered members
3. Find the NRM you want to convert
4. Click the **Actions** icon next to their name
5. Select **Send invite** from the dropdown menu
6. In the modal that appears, enter:
   - Their email address
   - Select their role
7. Click **Send invite** to complete the process

The NRM will receive an email invitation to create their Shelf account. Once they accept, they will have self-service access to your workspace while maintaining their existing asset relationships and history.

## Important Notes

- The NRM will remain in your system until they accept the invitation
- Their current asset assignments and custody history will be preserved after conversion
- You can track pending invitations in the **Users** tab under **Team > Pending Invites**
