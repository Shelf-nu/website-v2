## How to Duplicate an Asset

1. Navigate to the asset page you want to duplicate
2. Click the "Actions" dropdown menu
3. Select "Duplicate"
4. Enter the number of duplicates you want to create
5. Click "Duplicate" to confirm

The new assets will be created with "(copy [ID])" appended to their names. For example, duplicating "Shimadzu GCMS-QP2020 NX" produces "Shimadzu GCMS-QP2020 NX (copy 1729610912949)".

## Important Considerations

### Custom Fields and Unique Data

When duplicating assets, all custom fields -- including those requiring unique values like serial numbers, MAC addresses, or asset tags -- will be copied from the original asset. This means:

- **All duplicates will initially have identical custom field values**
- **You'll need to update unique identifiers manually for each duplicate**
- **Required fields with unique constraints may need immediate attention**

### Best Practices

- **Bulk Asset Creation**: While duplicating can be efficient for creating multiple similar assets, it's not recommended for assets that require unique identifiers
- **Inventory Accuracy**: Ensure you update any unique fields immediately after duplication to maintain accurate records
- **Asset Tracking**: Consider using the CSV import feature instead of duplication when adding multiple assets with unique attributes

### When to Use Duplication

- Creating multiple identical assets without unique identifiers
- Setting up template assets for future use
- Quick creation of similar assets where unique fields can be updated later

### When to Avoid Duplication

- Adding assets that require unique serial numbers
- Creating inventory items that need distinct identification
- Managing regulated equipment requiring unique tracking

## Alternative Approaches

For adding multiple assets with unique identifiers, consider:

- Using the CSV import feature
- Creating assets individually
