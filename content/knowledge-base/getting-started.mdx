## Step 1: You Got Your License -- What's Next?

Upon purchasing a Team License, your license applies to a workspace you own.

- If you had a trial workspace, it's now **upgraded**.
- If you purchased via invoice without an existing workspace, **you'll need to create it manually**.

Create your team workspace at the account details section.

> **Note:** Each user can have only one personal workspace, but there's no limit to how many team workspaces you can create or join.

## Step 2: Add Your Assets

You can populate your workspace in three ways:

### Option 1 -- Add Manually

Create assets individually using the "Add asset" button inside your workspace.

### Option 2 -- Import via CSV

Use the CSV Import Helper to prepare your import file. Shelf automatically matches headers to your database fields.

> **Tip:** For items with existing QR or barcodes, ensure your header reflects the correct format (e.g., `barcode_Code128` for Code 128 barcodes).

**Minimal CSV Structure Example:**

| name | category | location | barcode_Code128 |
|------|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Canon 70D | Camera | Main Studio | 123456789012 |
| Tripod | Grip | Storage Room | 654321987654 |

### Option 3 -- Add or Link QR Codes

Two approaches available:

1. **Shelf Codes (Generated in-app):** Add or print labels from within Shelf.
2. **External Codes (Add-On Enabled):** Include existing codes directly in CSV or link manually.

For manual linking, see: [How to use alternative barcodes in Shelf](/knowledge-base/alternative-barcodes).

## Step 3: Printing Labels and QR Codes

### 1. From an Asset Page

Open any asset and click "Download" on the asset label to generate a .png file.

> **Note:** Shelf labels are square (1:1 aspect ratio) -- use square label paper for efficiency.

### 2. From the Asset Index (Bulk Download)

Go to your Assets list, select multiple assets, click "Actions", then "Download QR codes" to receive a .zip file.

> **Warning:** If QR codes appear empty, simply click "Download QR codes" again.

## Step 4: Invite Your Team

Once your workspace is ready, invite team members through the user management section:

- Invite users via email
- Assign appropriate roles: Admin, Manager, Staff, Viewer
- Review permissions in the user roles documentation

> **Important:** Verify you're in the correct workspace (check top-left corner) before inviting users.

## Step 5: Start Managing Your Assets

Once setup is complete, you can:

- Assign custody or ownership of assets
- Create and approve bookings
- Scan QR codes to check in/out equipment
- Track maintenance and usage through activity logs

> **Tip:** Use Categories, Locations, and Kits to organize your database efficiently.
