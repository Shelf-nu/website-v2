## Overview

This feature enables custom fields to dynamically appear based on the category assigned to an asset, ensuring relevant information displays when needed most.

## Why Link Custom Fields to Categories?

**Improved Relevance:** By associating custom fields with categories, users see only pertinent information during asset creation or editing, streamlining data entry and reducing unnecessary clutter.

**Better Organization:** Categories form a fundamental part of organizing assets within the platform. Linking custom fields to specific categories maintains consistency in asset management workflows.

## Benefits

- **Efficiency:** Users focus on relevant information without overwhelming unnecessary fields, accelerating the asset management process.
- **Accuracy:** Displaying only pertinent fields significantly reduces errors or omissions.
- **Customization:** Organizations can tailor workflows to specific needs, promoting efficiency and consistency.

## Example Scenario

For "Office Equipment" assets, relevant custom fields include "Purchase Date" and "Maintenance Schedule." For "Tools," fields like "Tool Type" and "Last Calibration Date" prove essential for maintaining optimal equipment condition.

## How It Works

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Custom fields**
2. **Create** or **Edit** a custom field
3. Toggle **Use for select categories**
4. Select the desired category
5. Add multiple categories using **Add another category**
6. **Save** or **Create** the custom field

The configured custom field dynamically appears when creating or editing assets after specifying the category.

## Data Preservation

When changing an asset's category, previously attached custom field values remain securely stored. Switching categories and reverting later preserves custom field data, ensuring continuity. These values are included in database backups and exports for added data integrity assurance.
