After configuring the name, booking period and custodian for a booking you can start adding assets and/or kits. Configuring the booking period prior to adding assets or kits is required because the system needs to know if the selected assets will be available for booking during that period. It could be that certain assets are already part of a booking during the selected period.

## Adding assets to a booking

Clicking Add assets will open an asset manager modal that allows you to browse assets available during the specified booking period. Use the filters and search bar to quickly find the assets you would like to add.

1. Click **Manage assets**
2. Select the Assets you would like to add by checking them
3. Use the filters or search bar to quickly find assets
4. Click Confirm to add your selection of assets to the booking

## Removing assets from a booking

1. Find the asset(s) you would like to remove in the index
2. Click the dropdown icon and click **Remove**
3. Alternatively, click **Manage assets**, uncheck the asset(s) you would like to remove and **Confirm**

## Adding kits to a booking

If you or other users have configured one or more kits you'll be able to utilize this when creating a booking. By adding a kit to a booking you are simply adding assets that are grouped together at once.

1. Click **Manage assets**
2. Switch from **Assets** to **Kits** using the tabs
3. Select one or multiple kits
4. Click **Confirm** to add your selection of kits to the booking
