## Overview

Kits represent a unified management approach in Shelf for handling related equipment as a single unit. This feature proves beneficial when multiple items need to move and be tracked collectively.

## Kits vs Tags: Two Grouping Approaches

The platform offers distinct methods for asset organization:

**Kits** function best for:

- Managing assets as one consolidated unit
- Single QR code covering the entire kit
- Unified custody assignments where all items move together
- Collective booking management

**Tags** work better when you need:

- Individual asset management within groups
- Ability to book or assign custody to single items
- Dynamic grouping without custody restrictions

## Creating a Kit

Navigate to the Kits page and select **New Kit**. Complete the setup by entering a name, image, and description, then add desired assets. You can also assign a custodian during creation.

## Kit Statuses

Kits can exist in three states:

- **Available**: Ready for assignment to a person or booking
- **In Custody**: Currently held by a person; unavailable for reassignment until released
- **Checked Out**: Assigned to a booking and unavailable for reassignment

## Kit Assets

Assets can be added regardless of individual availability status. Even items marked as unavailable for bookings can be included. However, kits cannot be assigned until all contained assets become available.

## Assigning Custody

Navigate to the kit page and select **Assign Custody**. Choose the team member to receive custody responsibility. The kit updates to reflect the new custodian.

## Audit Trail

Each individual asset page documents kit custody changes to designated persons, creating a transparent record of modifications.

## Tracking Assignments

Kit assignments display on the kit page, enabling easy identification of current custodians.
