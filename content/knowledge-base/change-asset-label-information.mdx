Managing large inventories requires effective asset identification methods. Teams can choose between Shelf's automatically-generated unique QR code identifiers or sequential asset numbers following patterns like SAM-0001. The QR Code Display customization feature gives you the flexibility to choose which identifier appears on your QR labels, enabling organizations to work exactly as their teams think about assets.

## Understanding Your Options

Two choices exist for QR label identifiers:

### QR Code ID (Default)

Unique identifiers automatically generated by Shelf, such as `clm123abc456def`. These work well for digital-first workflows prioritizing scanning over manual reference.

Best for:

- Teams using scanning for asset lookup
- Organizations without sequential number requirements
- Workflows relying primarily on digital tracking

### Sequential Asset Number (SAM ID)

Ordered, human-readable numbers like SAM-0001, SAM-0002 following predictable patterns. These facilitate easy reference in conversations, reports, and physical documentation.

Best for:

- Schools and institutions with numbered equipment
- Organizations transitioning from manual tracking
- Teams referencing asset numbers verbally
- Combined digital and physical asset management workflows

## Real-World Use Cases

**School Equipment Management**
As a school IT administrator managing hundreds of laptops, tablets, and projectors, using sequential SAM IDs means teachers can easily report issues by reference number rather than complex codes.

**Corporate Asset Tracking**
Sequential numbering maintains continuity while gaining digital tracking benefits. Employees still reference equipment the same way they always have, but now the organization has comprehensive digital records.

**Inventory Audits**
Sequential numbers on labels enable quick verification during quarterly audits, with immediate gap identification.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What happens if I switch preferences after creating assets?**
Existing QR codes continue functioning perfectly. Only newly viewed or downloaded labels reflect updated preferences.

**Can I have some assets use QR IDs and others use SAM IDs?**
The setting applies workspace-wide for all new labels, though you can change preferences and download new labels as needed.

**What if an asset doesn't have a SAM ID assigned?**
Shelf automatically falls back to QR Code ID display, ensuring working QR codes even without sequential assignments.

**Do I need to re-download existing QR codes?**
No. Existing QR codes work unchanged. The setting only affects newly viewed or downloaded labels.

**Can I change this setting multiple times?**
Yes. Switch between formats as often as needed, adapting to evolving workflow requirements.

## Getting Started
