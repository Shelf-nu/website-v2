- **Furniture**: Dimensions, materials, purchase information

## Setting Up Custom Fields

1. **Navigate** to Settings > Custom Fields
2. **Design your field**:
   - Choose a clear, descriptive name
   - Select the most appropriate field type
   - Write helpful placeholder text
   - Add guidance in the help text field
3. **Configure requirements**:
   - Set as required for critical information
   - Map to specific asset categories when needed
   - Set active status for immediate use
4. **Test and refine**:
   - Create a test asset to verify field behavior
   - Adjust settings based on user feedback
   - Monitor data quality and consistency

## Best Practices for Custom Fields

### Field Design Principles

- **Start essential, expand gradually**: Begin with must-have fields and add more as workflows mature
- **Use consistent naming**: Establish clear conventions (e.g., "Purchase Date" vs "Date Purchased")
- **Choose types thoughtfully**: Amount vs Number makes a big difference in usage
- **Provide clear help text**: Guide users on format and expectations

### Data Quality Management

- **Make critical fields required**: Ensure completeness for essential information
- **Use Option fields for standardization**: Prevent inconsistent entries
- **Regular review cycles**: Periodically assess which fields are actually used
- **Category mapping strategy**: Balance specificity with simplicity

### Performance Optimization

- **Limit initial visible fields**: Too many fields overwhelm users
- **Strategic required fields**: Only require truly essential information
- **Meaningful field grouping**: Use categories to organize related fields
- **Regular cleanup**: Deactivate unused fields rather than deleting

## Working with Custom Fields Data

### Advanced Filtering

Custom fields unlock powerful search capabilities:

- Combine multiple field filters for precise asset queries
- Use amount fields for budget-based filtering
- Leverage number fields for specification-based searches
- Create saved filter combinations for repeated use

### Reporting and Export

- Export custom field data with proper formatting
- Amount fields automatically include currency symbols
- Number fields maintain precision for technical data
- Date fields export in standard formats for analysis

### Data Import Strategies

- Use provided CSV templates to ensure proper formatting
- Amount fields: Enter numbers without currency symbols (1234.56)
- Number fields: Include negative values when needed (-40)
- Test imports with small batches before full deployment

## Integration with Workflows

Custom fields integrate seamlessly with Shelf's core features:

- **QR Code Labels**: Include custom field data on printed labels
- **Mobile Scanning**: View and edit custom fields via mobile devices
- **Booking System**: Custom fields help identify the right assets for bookings
