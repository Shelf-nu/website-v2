## Setting Up an Asset Reminder

To set up a reminder for an asset, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Navigate to the Asset Page

Open the asset for which you want to create a reminder.

### Step 2: Create a New Reminder

Click on "Actions" in the top right corner and select "Set Reminder" from the dropdown menu.

### Step 3: Configure Reminder Details

Fill out the following required information:

- **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for your reminder
- **Message**: Add details about what needs attention
- **Alert Date**: Set the date and time when the reminder should be sent
- **Team Members**: Select who should receive this reminder

### Step 4: Confirm Creation

Click "Confirm" to create the reminder. The system will send email notifications to selected team members when the alert date arrives.

## Managing Reminders

### Viewing Reminders

You can view reminders in two locations:

1. **Asset Overview Tab**: Shows upcoming reminders in the reminders widget
2. **Alerts Tab**: Displays all reminders associated with the asset

### Editing Reminders

You can edit pending reminders by:

1. Going to the Alerts tab
2. Finding the reminder you want to modify
3. Clicking the edit icon
4. Making your changes
5. Clicking "Confirm" to save

### Deleting Reminders

To delete a reminder:

1. Navigate to the Alerts tab
2. Locate the reminder you want to remove
3. Click the delete icon
4. Confirm deletion

**Important Notes:**

- Reminders can only be edited while they are in "Pending" status
- Once a reminder has been sent, it cannot be edited, only deleted
- Deleting an asset will also delete all associated reminders
- You cannot set reminders for dates in the past
- Multiple reminders can be set for the same asset

## Reminder Statuses

Reminders can have the following statuses:

- **Pending**: Scheduled but not yet sent
- **Sent**: Notification has been delivered to recipients

## Team Member Considerations

- Only workspace members can be selected as reminder recipients
- If a team member is removed from the workspace, any reminders assigned to them will be sent to the workspace owner instead
- You can assign multiple team members to receive the same reminder
