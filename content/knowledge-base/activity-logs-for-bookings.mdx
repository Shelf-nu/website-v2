## Overview

The Activity tab in each booking creates a chronological record of all booking-related events and team notes. This centralized log enables teams to monitor conversations, updates, and automated system changes throughout a booking's lifecycle.

## Purpose

Activity Logs serve these key functions:

- **Centralize updates** - All booking events and team notes are recorded in one timeline
- **Clarify context** - Manual notes are clearly distinguished from automated system updates
- **Preserve history** - Every change is stored for future reference, reducing the need to search external tools or messages

## What Appears in the Activity Log

### System Updates

Shelf automatically records major booking events, including:

- Status changes (Booked, In Progress, Closed)
- Schedule and description edits
- Asset or kit additions and removals
- Partial and complete check-ins

### Team Notes

Users can add their own entries:

- Compose notes in Markdown with live previews
- Edit or remove your own notes at any time
- Clear attribution shows who added the note and when

## Formatting and Readability

Activity Logs use Markdoc components to enhance readability. Features include:

- Localized timestamps
- Status badges
- Asset and kit popovers
- Expandable descriptions
- Consistent deep links to related records

## Technical Details

Activity Logs are powered by the BookingNote data model and lightweight asset/kit APIs. This ensures the feed performs efficiently, remains scoped to each organization, and scales reliably with usage.

## Example Use Cases

- Tracking which assets were returned during a Partial Check-in
- Reviewing when a booking's schedule or description was updated
- Keeping a record of team communication tied directly to the booking
- Auditing asset movements across the booking lifecycle

## How to Access

Open any booking in Shelf and select the Activity tab. All system updates and team notes appear in chronological order.
