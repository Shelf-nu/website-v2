Use sublocations when your equipment is spread across multiple sites, buildings, rooms or cages, when different teams share the same building, or when you need cleaner reporting by building/floor/room. If you only have a handful of locations, a flat list is still fine.

## What Sublocations Are

Sublocations in Shelf are **not a separate object type**. There is only one kind of location. A "sublocation" is simply a location that has another location set as its Parent location.

By filling in the **Parent location** field, you can build hierarchies instead of a flat list, for example:

`Campus > Building > Floor > Room > Rack`

Every node is just a normal location that can hold assets and kits.

## What Sublocations Are Good For

Use sublocations when:

- You manage equipment across multiple sites or buildings
- You need to know not just _which warehouse_, but _which room or cage_
- Different teams share the same building but use different areas
- You want cleaner reporting by building, floor, room, etc.

If you only have a few locations, a flat list is fine. Shelf supports hierarchies up to **12 levels deep** per organization.

## How to Create a New Location as a Sublocation

1. Go to **Locations** in the left sidebar.
2. Click **Create location**.
3. Enter a **Name** (for example: `Storage room`, `Control Room`, `Camera Cage`).
4. In the **Parent location** field:
   - Leave it as **No parent** if this is a top-level location, or
   - Select the location it belongs under (for example: `Meander 901` or `Studio A`).
5. (Optional) Add a **Main image**, **Address**, and **Description**.
6. Click **Save**.

A sublocation is created when a link is established to a parent element. You'll see it in the Locations index (with Parent location and Child locations columns), on its parent's page in the Child locations list/tree, and anywhere you can assign assets and kits to locations.

## Turning an Existing Location into a Sublocation

You can convert existing flat locations into a hierarchy by setting their **Parent location**.

1. Go to **Locations** and click the location you want to re-organize (for example: `Post-Production Suite`).
2. On the edit page, find the **Parent location** field.
3. Change it from **No parent** to the correct parent (for example: `Studio A` or `Meander 901`).
4. Click **Save**.

All assets and kits assigned to that location stay attached. Only its **position in the hierarchy** changes.

> **Note:** You can only pick a parent inside the **same organization/workspace**. Sublocations cannot cross organization boundaries.

## Navigating Your Location Hierarchy

Shelf gives you two main ways to see where you are in the tree.

### Breadcrumbs

At the top of the location page you'll see a breadcrumb, for example:

`Meander 901 / Studio A / Post-Production Suite`

You can click any part of the breadcrumb to jump up the hierarchy.

### Child Locations

On the parent location's page you'll see a **Child locations** list/tree. From there you can:

- See how many locations live under a parent
- Click into any child location quickly
- Build out deeper levels (e.g. `Building > Floor > Room`)

In the **Locations** index you'll also see:

- A **Parent location** column (who this location lives under)
- A **Child locations** column (how many locations sit below this one)

## Limits and Safeguards

To keep hierarchies healthy:

- **Max depth:** A hierarchy can go up to **12 levels** deep. If you try to nest deeper, Shelf will block the change and show an error.
- **No loops:** A location **cannot be its own parent** and cannot be placed under one of its own descendants.
- **Same organization only:** A parent must belong to the **same organization**.
- **Same behaviour everywhere:** Assets and kits behave the same on every node (parent or child).

## Example Hierarchies

### University Campus

`Campus > Faculty building > Floor > Lab > Storage cabinet`

### Production Company

`Meander 901 > Studio A > Post-Production Suite > Gear Room`

### Utilities / Field Services

`Region > Substation > Building > Room > Rack`

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I have to use sublocations?**
No. Existing flat locations continue to work. You can adopt sublocations gradually, starting with one site or building.

**What happens to assets if I change a location's parent?**
Assets and kits **stay attached** to that location. You're only changing where the location appears in the hierarchy.

**Can I see one big tree across all workspaces?**
No. Location hierarchies are scoped to a single **organization/workspace**.

**Can I change the hierarchy later?**
Yes. You can add, rename, and re-parent locations as your spaces change, as long as you respect the depth and loop rules above.

## Next Steps

1. Open **Locations** in your Shelf workspace.
2. Identify your top-level locations (e.g. sites or buildings) -- keep **Parent location = No parent**.
3. For rooms, studios, cages or smaller areas, set **Parent location** to the site/building they live under.

Once your first branch is in place, you can gradually move more locations into the hierarchy and keep your inventory aligned with how your physical spaces are actually laid out.
