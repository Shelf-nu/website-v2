At Shelf, we prioritize the security and efficiency of our data management system. This flow chart illustrates the journey of data within our application, from the moment a user interacts with our platform to the secure storage of information in our databases.

## Key Components

1. **Client Web Browser** -- The entry point for all user interactions.
2. **Web App (Remix)** -- The main application, hosted on Fly.io's SOC 2 Type 2 compliant servers.
3. **Supabase** -- The robust backend solution, handling authentication, data storage, and database management.
4. **Stripe** -- Manages all payment and subscription-related processes.
5. **Sentry** -- The error logging and monitoring system.
6. **Microsoft Clarity** -- Web Performance / Javascript Error Tracking.
7. **SSO & SCIM** -- Enables seamless integration with Microsoft or Google authentication systems.

## Security Measures

- All HTTP requests are secured using SSL/TLS 128-bit encryption with TLS 1.3 protocol.
- The PostgreSQL database is encrypted with AES-256, ensuring top-tier data protection.
- Strict RLS (Row Level Security) policies maintain data integrity and access control.

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a seamless, secure, and scalable solution for all your asset management needs. By leveraging industry-leading technologies and following best practices in data security, Shelf ensures valuable information remains protected and accessible.
