## Your Personal Workspace

Every Shelf account comes with a Personal workspace. Even if you got invited to a workspace by someone from your team you will still have your very own workspace to work in.

## How to Create a Plus or Team Workspace

In order to create a new workspace you will have to upgrade your account with a Plus or Team subscription.

**Steps:**

- Log into the Shelf account that you want to upgrade
- Go to **Settings** > **Subscriptions**
- Choose the subscription that fits your needs
- Continue with payment
- A message will state that you have successfully upgraded your account

### Plus Workspaces

A workspace upgraded with a Plus subscription unlocks features like Unlimited custom fields, Asset Import/Export, Bookings and more. After purchasing, a new Plus workspace is created and owned by you, while your Personal workspace remains. Currently, owning more than 2 workspaces requires contacting sales.

### Team Workspaces

A workspace upgraded with a Team subscription allows you to invite users as team members. Team workspaces unlock all Plus features plus team collaboration capabilities. Similar to Plus, a new Team workspace is created upon purchase, and owning more than 2 workspaces requires sales contact.

## Switching Workspaces

Easily switch between workspaces by using the top dropdown in the side navigation bar, enabling swift movement between workspaces you have access to.

## Edit a Workspace That You Own

Modify the Name, Logo, and Currency for your workspace.

**Steps:**

- Go to **Settings** > **Workspaces**
- Click the **Actions** icon and choose **Edit**
- Make adjustments to **Name**, **Logo**, and **Currency**

## Remove a Workspace

Removing a workspace is currently only possible by contacting support directly via email.
