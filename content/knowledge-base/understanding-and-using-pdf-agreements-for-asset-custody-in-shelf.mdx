Shelf's signed custody feature enables administrators to attach PDF documents to custody transfers, creating formal agreements between asset owners and custodians. The system supports two agreement types: read-only (requiring acknowledgment) and signature-required (requiring electronic signatures).

## Key Features

### Enhanced Accountability and Documentation

The system establishes a clear audit trail of who has taken responsibility for assets while providing legal documentation capabilities. Users must ensure agreements comply with their jurisdiction's requirements.

### Agreement Types

- **Read-only agreements** require custodians to confirm document review
- **Signature-required agreements** demand electronic signatures before custody transfers complete

### Flexible Implementation

Agreements are optional and can be applied selectively -- some assets require them while others don't, accommodating different asset values and risk levels.

## Setup and Management

Administrators access **Settings > PDF Agreements** to create templates by uploading PDFs and designating agreement type. Templates receive names, active/inactive status, and can be customized for different scenarios (equipment training, custody terms, etc.).

When assigning custody, administrators toggle "Add PDF Agreement" and select appropriate templates. Registered users receive email notifications with review links; non-registered members require manual link sharing since they lack system email addresses.

## Special Considerations

### Kit Custody

When kits receive custody assignments, all contained assets automatically synchronize. Individual asset custodies are released and reassigned through the kit, with pending receipts cancelled during this process.

### Record Keeping

Completed agreements are accessible through the Signed Custody section (showing Agreements and Receipts), asset detail pages, or kit pages. Receipt statuses include:

- **Pending** -- Awaiting custodian action
- **Completed** -- Agreement acknowledged or signed
- **Declined** -- Custodian rejected the agreement
- **Cancelled** -- Agreement was cancelled by administrator
