Assigning user roles allows you to regulate what different team members or colleagues can view when granting them access to the workspace.

> At the moment we offer 5 different user roles (Owner, Administrator, Self-service, Base, and Non Registered Member) with static permissions.

When you grant a team member or colleague access to a workspace you will have the ability to assign them a specific role depending on what that user needs to view and do.

**Note:** Inviting team members is a team plan feature.

## Account Owner

The Account owner possesses complete access to the account and they have full permission to do everything in the workspace. They are basically an Administrator with some additional permissions like the authority to **upgrade or cancel subscriptions.** Only one Account owner is permitted at a time.

## Administrator

Users with an Administrator role possess comprehensive access to their workspace across all locations. Their permissions include:

- **Managing assets:** Administrators are able to create, update, and archive equipment. Additionally, they can modify categories, tags and locations and oversee the transfer of assets in custody.
- **Managing users:** They have the authority to invite other users to the workspace and adjust the roles of existing users.
- **Managing bookings:** Administrators are capable of creating, updating, and fulfilling (checking in/out) bookings, including those initiated by other users. They also have the ability to clear booking labels and disregard booking conflicts.
- **Managing settings:** Administrators hold complete access to the account's settings, allowing them full control over configuration and adjustments.

## Self-Service

Self Service users have enhanced capabilities compared to BASE users, bridging the gap between BASE and Administrator roles:

- **Asset overview:** They have access to view equipment listings but lack the ability to create, update, or expire equipment. Additionally, they cannot manage flags, change item locations, or handle custody transactions.
- **Asset management:** They have the ability to self assign and self remove custody of assets.
- **User management:** Self Service users are limited to viewing only their personal user page and cannot manage other users within the account.
- **Creating and managing bookings:** They have the capability to book assets for themselves and can check out and check in their own bookings. This provides more autonomy in the booking process.
- **Settings:** These users have limited access to settings, only able to view and edit their own account details. They are unable to create/invite any new team members.

## BASE (formerly "Self Service")

BASE users have foundational access to the system, with limited capabilities:

- **Asset overview:** They have access to view equipment listings but cannot create, update, or expire equipment. They also cannot manage flags, change item locations, or handle custody transactions.
- **User management:** BASE users are limited to viewing only their personal user page and cannot manage other users within the account.
- **Creating bookings:** They have the capability to create booking requests for themselves. However, they do not have the authority to check out or check in assets. An Administrator must handle both the check-out and check-in processes on their behalf.
- **Settings:** These users are restricted from viewing or making changes in the Settings area, excluding their own account details. They are unable to create/invite any new team members. Their permissions are solely centered around asset viewing and personal booking request creation.

## NRM (Non Registered Member)

An NRM user refers to an individual whose name is recorded in an asset management system without login credentials.

These users serve as placeholders to assign custody of assets and maintain tracking records.

This feature is useful when there is a need to **attribute ownership of assets to specific individuals who do not require access to the asset management platform.**

By using an NRM, organizations can ensure proper accountability and visibility over their inventory while limiting access to sensitive information.
