## How Early Check-in/Check-out Works

### Early Check-out

When checking out assets before the scheduled start date:

- A warning message appears notifying you that the booking start date will be adjusted to the current time
- You can choose to:
  - Cancel the action
  - Adjust the date (updating the booking start date to now)
  - Proceed without adjusting dates

### Early Check-in

When checking in assets before the scheduled end date:

- You receive a warning that the booking end date will be adjusted to the current time
- Options include:
  - Cancel
  - Adjust the date (updating the booking end date to now)
  - Proceed without changing dates

## Original Booking Dates

The system preserves original booking information:

- Initial booking dates are stored as `originalFrom` and `originalTo`
- Original dates remain even when actual booking dates are adjusted
- Booking details display both the actual and original booking periods
- Access this information through your [booking data export](/knowledge-base/bookings-how-to-export-booking-information-and-assets-checked-out)

## Important Notes

- When creating or updating draft bookings, both actual and original dates are updated
- Original dates are preserved only during early check-in/check-out operations
- Scheduled reminders and overdue notifications follow actual booking dates, not original dates
- CSV exports include both actual and original booking dates

## Use Cases

This feature helps when:

- Equipment is no longer needed for the full originally scheduled period
- Equipment must be returned early for urgent requests
- Tracking actual versus planned usage for reporting and analytics

The ability to track both original and adjusted periods provides transparency for resource planning and utilization analysis.
