## Upgrading to a Team Subscription

To transition from a personal account to a Team subscription, follow these steps:

- A personal account is required before upgrading to a Team plan
- Your personal account can be registered using either a personal or company email address
- Within your Personal workspace, navigate to **Settings > Workspace** to locate the upgrade option
- After upgrading to Team status, you have the ability to create a new workspace designated for your team
- Your Team workspace allows you to add a logo, description, and designate co-administrators
- As the account OWNER, you automatically retain access to the new Team workspace
- You can invite non-registered team members and grant them custody permissions over assets
- These members can later be promoted to administrator roles while maintaining their custodianship responsibilities

Once you complete this process, you will have successfully upgraded to a Team account and gained access to the expanded feature set.
