## Overview

If you want to try out team asset management features, a trial provides an excellent starting point. You can explore Shelf at your own pace by importing inventory or creating items individually. The trial enables testing of the bookings module and customizing fields without restrictions, plus inviting co-administrators to your workspace.

## How to Activate a Team Workspace Trial

1. Create an account on Shelf (each account creates a personal workspace)
2. Navigate to settings, then the subscription tab
3. In the Team plan column, select the button to activate a trial, which directs you to a confirmation page

## Key Trial Details

### Duration and Support

At trial's end, a Shelf team member will contact you for feedback and discuss whether a subscription suits your business.

### Payment Requirements

The trial does not require any payment method. Your team workspace will pause when the trial concludes -- you will have the option to add payment details and continue.

### Getting Started

All that is needed is a Shelf account. For assistance, contact the support team at support@shelf.nu.
