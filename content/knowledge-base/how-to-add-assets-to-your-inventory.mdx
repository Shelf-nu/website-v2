Adding your equipment inventory to your Shelf system is essential for streamlining operations, reducing costs, and enabling focus on core activities. Multiple methods accommodate different organizational needs and preferences.

## Adding Assets Manually

For smaller inventories, you can input assets individually. Follow the standard process for [adding new assets](/knowledge-base/adding-new-assets) one at a time.

Leverage custom fields to capture detailed asset information. This approach provides valuable insights and improves overall inventory management. Consult documentation on custom field usage for further guidance.

## Importing Assets via Spreadsheet

For larger inventories, the bulk import feature significantly reduces manual data entry time. When you have numerous assets to add, using this functionality streamlines the process considerably.

Prepare your spreadsheet according to specific requirements before initiating the import process to ensure compatibility and accuracy.
