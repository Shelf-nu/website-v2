Shelf offers a powerful feature: **Custom Property IDs.** This feature allows you to assign unique identifiers to your assets, separate from the system-generated Asset ID. Here is everything you need to know about using Property IDs effectively.

## What is a Property ID?

A Property ID is a custom, user-defined identifier for an asset. It can be any string of characters that helps you easily identify and locate your assets. This is particularly useful if you have existing asset tracking systems or want to use your own numbering scheme.

## Benefits of Using Property IDs

1. **Integration with existing systems**: Match your current asset labeling scheme
2. **Easy asset lookup**: Quickly find assets using familiar identifiers
3. **Custom QR codes**: Generate QR codes using your Property IDs for seamless scanning

## How to Set a Property ID

1. When creating or editing an asset, you will see a "Property ID" field
2. Enter your desired identifier in this field
3. Save the asset -- the Property ID is now associated with it

## Using Custom URLs with Property IDs

One of the most powerful features of Property IDs is the ability to use custom URLs to quickly access asset information. Here is how it works:

1. **Structure**: Your custom URL will look like this: `https://app.shelf.nu/property/[Your-Property-ID]`
2. **Example**: If your Property ID is "LAPTOP-001", your custom URL would be: `https://app.shelf.nu/property/LAPTOP-001`
3. **Redirecting**: When you or anyone with appropriate permissions visits this URL, they will be automatically redirected to the full asset page

## Practical Applications

- Generate QR codes using these custom URLs for your physical asset labels
- Quickly look up assets by typing the custom URL in your browser
- Share asset information easily with team members using the Property ID

## Best Practices

- Keep Property IDs unique within your organization
- Use a consistent naming convention for easy recognition
- Consider including information like asset type or location in the ID

Remember, Property IDs are optional. If you do not set one, the asset will still have its system-generated Asset ID for reference.

By utilizing Property IDs, you can create a more tailored and efficient asset management system that aligns perfectly with your organization's needs.
