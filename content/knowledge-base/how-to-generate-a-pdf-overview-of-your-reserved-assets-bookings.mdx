## Generating a PDF of Your Booking / Reservation

The bookings feature allows you to pre-book assets from your available inventory. Whether you're preparing for a big event or just need to keep track of equipment loans, having a printable list can be incredibly useful. Here's how to generate a PDF overview:

1. Navigate to any booking in your Shelf account
2. Locate the action dropdown menu
3. Click on "GENERATE PDF"

## What's Included in the PDF?

When you generate a PDF, the server creates a comprehensive document containing:

- Workspace name
- Booking name
- Custodian responsible for the booking
- Booking period (start and end dates/times)
- Booking description
- Detailed asset data (name, kit, category, location, QR code)
- Date of PDF generation

## Practical Applications

Users have found numerous valuable applications for this feature:

1. **Pre-packing Checklist**: Use the PDF as a checklist when packing items for transport, ensuring nothing is left behind.
2. **Physical Sign-off**: Collect physical signatures from custodians taking responsibility for assets, providing accountability.
3. **Offline Backup**: Keep a physical record of assets checked out, useful where digital access might be limited.
4. **Inventory Audits**: Quickly cross-reference physical assets against the booking list during audits or spot checks.

## Best Practices

- Generate the PDF shortly before the booking start date to ensure up-to-date information.
- Consider keeping both digital and physical copies for redundancy.
- Use the QR codes on the PDF to quickly check in assets upon their return.
