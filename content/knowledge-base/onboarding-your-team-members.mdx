## Overview

Account owners can add team members to a Shelf workspace with flexibility in roles. You can create non-registered team members (NRMs) or invite users with Shelf accounts. The key distinction is that users have direct account access, while NRMs are contacts used for bookings and asset custody without direct platform access.

## Non-Registered Members

Non-registered team members are individuals designated for use in bookings or asset custody. They lack direct account access unless invited to become users. NRMs represent people your team interacts with -- such as those borrowing assets -- who do not directly use Shelf. Adding NRMs is accomplished through the Team tab in Settings.

## Users

Users receive workspace access with permission levels tailored to team requirements. When invited, they receive an email to create login credentials (or gain access if they already have a Shelf account). Account owners can revoke access at any time. Existing NRMs can be converted to users by sending invitations.

## User Roles and Permissions

Currently available roles include Account Owner, Administrator, Self-service, and Base, each with preset permissions. The platform plans to add more customizable roles and permissions in the future.

For detailed permission information, see the dedicated article on [user roles and their permissions](/knowledge-base/user-roles-and-their-permissions).
