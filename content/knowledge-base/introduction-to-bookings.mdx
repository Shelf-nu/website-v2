## Overview

With bookings, users can reserve equipment for designated periods. Assets or kits added to a booking are assigned to a custodian during the specified timeframe. During this period, items receive a "Checked out" status and become unavailable for overlapping bookings. This system prevents conflicts and ensures equipment availability when needed.

## Required Booking Information

A booking requires four essential components:

1. A **Name**
2. **Start** and **End** date/time
3. Selection of **Assets** and/or **Kits**
4. A **Custodian**

## Booking States

### 1. Draft

The booking is being configured. To proceed, you must fill in the Name, Start/End dates, and Custodian. You can then add assets or kits and perform a **Reserve** action. Deletion is still possible at this stage.

### 2. Reserved

The booking is fully configured. Assets become unavailable for overlapping bookings. The booking period is in the future and hasn't been checked out yet -- assets retain an **Available** status. Administrators can still take or assign custody. Options include **Check-out**, **Delete**, or **Cancel**.

### 3. Ongoing

The **Check-out** action has been performed. Assets now have a **Checked out** status and are in the custodian's possession. Administrators cannot take or assign custody during this phase. A **Check-in** action moves the booking to **Completed**. You can also **Delete** or **Cancel**.

### 4. Overdue

The booking's end date/time has passed without check-in. The system automatically changes the status to **Overdue**. Assets remain **Checked out**, potentially creating conflicts with other bookings. Perform **Check-in** to complete the booking, or **Delete** or **Cancel** it.

### 5. Completed

Assets have been returned and **Checked in**. The booking status changes to **Completed**, and asset statuses return to **Available**. You can now **Delete** or **Archive** the booking.

### 6. Archived

Completed bookings can be archived to organize the index. Archived bookings are hidden in the default view but accessible via dropdown filter selection.

### 7. Cancelled

Equipment managers can cancel non-completed bookings when they're no longer needed. Cancelled bookings remain logged but are hidden from the default index view.

## Notification Emails

The system sends automated emails to custodians and administrators at key stages:

- **Confirmation**: Sent when a booking reaches Reserved status
- **Check-out Reminder**: Sent 1 hour before the Start date/time
- **Check-in Reminder**: Sent 1 hour before the End date/time
- **Overdue**: Sent when the End date/time passes without check-in
- **Completed**: Sent when the booking is checked in
- **Cancelled**: Sent when an administrator cancels the booking
- **Deleted**: Sent when an administrator deletes the booking
