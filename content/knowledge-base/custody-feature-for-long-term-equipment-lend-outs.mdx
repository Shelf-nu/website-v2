## Using the Custody Functionality

Asset custody operates as an infinite checkout mechanism. You can document which assets have been borrowed and by whom, without requiring return dates or location specifications. This functionality proves valuable for assets borrowed for brief or extended periods.

## Assigning Custody of an Asset to a Team Member

1. Navigate to your Assets and select an asset from the index
2. Click **Actions**, then select **Give custody**
3. Choose a team member to receive custody over the asset

The Actions button reveals the Give custody option.

## Releasing Custody of an Asset

When a custodian returns the asset to the equipment room and you wish to make it available again, you can release custody.

1. Go to the asset page
2. Click **Actions** and select **Release custody**

The Actions button displays the Release custody option.

**Note:** Assets in custody display a blue status badge. Upon release, the asset becomes fully available again.

## Important

Only individuals with appropriate custody permissions can grant or remove custody from assets.
