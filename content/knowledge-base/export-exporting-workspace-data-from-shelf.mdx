Shelf provides multiple ways to export your asset data, giving you flexibility in managing and analyzing your inventory information. Whether you need to export your entire workspace or just a specific selection of assets, our export features help you get the data you need in CSV format.

## Export Methods

### 1. Export Selected Assets

- Navigate to the Assets index
- Select the assets you want to export using the checkboxes
- Click the **Export** button at the top of the asset list
- Your selected assets will be downloaded as a CSV file

### 2. Asset Backup (Workspace Export)

- Go to Workspace settings
- Under the **General** tab, locate the **Download CSV** button
- Click to download a complete backup of all workspace assets

**Important Note:** QR codes are not included in the backup export. Due to the nature of how Shelf's QR codes work, they currently cannot be exported with assets because they have unique IDs. If you restore a backup, new QR codes will be generated for each asset. For backup restoration assistance, please contact our support team.

### 3. Export Filtered Results

- Apply any filters you need in the Assets index (e.g., by category, location, tags)
