Change your Shelf user's email address.

**Available with:** All Shelf plans and subscriptions

## Before You Begin

- Ensure you are logged into your Shelf account to edit your email address
- If you've only logged in via a password manager or keychain, update the stored email address after completing these steps to avoid login issues
- The new email address cannot be the same as an existing Shelf user's email, unless that user has been permanently deleted
