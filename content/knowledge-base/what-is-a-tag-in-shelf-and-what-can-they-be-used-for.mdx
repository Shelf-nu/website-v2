## What is a Tag?

In Shelf, a **tag** represents a labeled attribute attachable to assets or bookings. Each tag includes a name, optional description, and a setting that determines whether it applies to assets, bookings, or both. This enables organizations to categorize items using flexible keywords that extend beyond standard fields like category or location.

## What Can Tags Be Used For?

- **Organizing and searching**: Tags facilitate grouping items by custom attributes (such as "needs-calibration" or "high-priority") and enable quick retrieval without depending solely on categories or locations.
- **Advanced filtering**: The asset index supports tag-based filters utilizing operators like "contains," "contains all," and "contains any," permitting precise searches based on single or multiple tags, including identification of "untagged" items.
- **Bulk operations**: Tags can be assigned or removed across numerous assets simultaneously using the bulk tagging workflow, which respects active filters to update large item sets efficiently.

## Why Tags Matter

Tags provide flexible, organization-specific context that complements standard fields. They enable refined searches, accelerate workflows, and support scalable bulk updates, helping teams maintain discoverable and consistent inventories.
