## How to Sort Your Assets

1. **Quick Sort:** Use the "Sorted by" dropdown in the top menu
2. **Column Selection:** Click "Pick a column to sort by" to choose from all available fields
3. **Direction Toggle:** Switch between ascending/descending using the toggle switch
4. **Clear Sorting:** Reset to default using "Clear all"

## Sort Behavior by Data Type

### Text Values

- Sorting is case-sensitive (uppercase letters come before lowercase)
- For alphanumeric text, characters are compared from left to right
- Numbers within text are treated as individual characters

### Numeric Values

- Assets are ordered by numeric value
- Empty values will appear at the beginning or end based on sort direction

### Dates

- Assets are ordered chronologically
- Ascending: Oldest dates appear first
- Descending: Newest dates appear first

### Status Field

- Organizes by availability state (Available, In custody, Checked out)

## Tips for Effective Sorting

- **Combine with Filters:** Use sorting alongside filters for more precise organization
- **Consistent Naming:** Adopt standardized naming conventions for better results
- **Leading Zeros:** For numerical identifiers, use leading zeros (e.g., "Asset001")
- **Export After Sorting:** Use "Export selection" to download your organized asset list

## Advanced Index Features

The Advanced Index view (accessible from the top right corner) enhances sorting with additional customization options and improved performance for larger asset collections. See the [Advanced Asset Index Complete Guide](/knowledge-base/advanced-asset-index-complete-guide) for more details.
