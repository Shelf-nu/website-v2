## Compatible Hardware

To use this feature, you will need:

- A handheld or wireless barcode scanner with QR code support
- The scanner must be properly connected to your computer (via USB or Bluetooth)
- The scanner should be configured to send an Enter/Return after scanning (most scanners do this by default)

## Scanner Modes

Shelf's scanner interface offers two modes:

- **Camera mode**: Uses your computer's webcam to scan QR codes
- **Barcode scanner mode**: Uses a connected handheld or wireless barcode scanner

You can toggle between these modes using the dropdown in the top-right corner of the scanner interface. This article focuses specifically on using the **Barcode scanner mode**.

## Using a Barcode Scanner with Shelf

To scan assets with your barcode scanner:

1. Ensure the scanner interface is in "Barcode scanner" mode
2. **Important**: Click inside the text field to ensure it is focused
3. Use your handheld or wireless barcode scanner to scan the QR code on your asset
4. The system will automatically process the scanned code and redirect you to the relevant asset page

## Scan to Add Feature in Bookings

One of the most powerful applications of the barcode scanner is in the Bookings module. The "Scan to Add" feature allows you to quickly add multiple assets to a booking by scanning their QR codes.

### Accessing Scan to Add

1. Navigate to the Bookings area in Shelf
2. Open an existing booking or create a new one
3. Click the **Scan** button in the Assets section

### Using Scan to Add

The Scan to Add interface allows you to scan multiple assets in succession:

1. Click in the text field to focus it
2. Scan each asset's QR code with your barcode scanner
3. Each scanned asset will appear in the list below the input field
4. Once you have scanned all desired assets, click **Confirm** to add them to your booking

Shelf will also show any potential conflicts directly from the scan to add interface.

## Tips for Optimal Barcode Scanner Performance

- Always ensure the text field is focused before scanning
- Test your scanner on a few QR codes before performing large batch operations
- If using a wireless scanner, check battery levels before beginning extensive scanning sessions
- For optimal efficiency, consider scanners with memory mode if you need to process many assets across multiple locations
- Make sure your scanner is properly configured to handle QR codes (some scanners may need specific configuration)

## Troubleshooting

If you are experiencing issues with your barcode scanner:

1. **Scanner not registering**: Ensure the text field on the Shelf interface is focused (clicked)
2. **Scanner reads but nothing appears**: Check if your scanner is correctly configured to send data to the active input field
3. **Partial code reading**: Verify that your scanner is properly configured for QR codes, not just linear barcodes
4. **Batch scanning issues**: Confirm you are using the "Scan to Add" feature in the Bookings area, as this is the only place that supports batch processing
