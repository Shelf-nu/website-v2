Shelf's alternative barcode feature extends beyond the standard QR codes automatically generated for assets and kits. This paid add-on enables organizations to integrate multiple barcode formats into their asset tracking systems.

## Supported Barcode Types

The feature supports four barcode types:

- **Code128**: 4-40 characters including letters, numbers, and symbols
- **Code39**: 4-43 alphanumeric characters
- **Data Matrix**: 4-100 characters, printable at extremely small sizes
- **EAN-13**: 13-digit numeric codes matching retail product standards

## Primary Use Cases

Organizations implement alternative barcodes to:

- Maintain existing barcode systems while adopting Shelf
- Facilitate departmental preferences for different code formats
- Preserve manufacturer identification codes
- Support space-constrained labeling scenarios

## Implementation Methods

Users can add barcodes through two approaches:

1. **Manual entry**: Type codes directly into the asset barcodes section
2. **Camera scanning**: Scan existing physical barcodes using a device camera. The system automatically detects barcode type and value during scanning.

## Operational Features

- Multiple barcodes can attach to single assets with no quantity limits
- All barcode types function identically within Shelf's scanning, booking, and check-in systems
- CSV bulk import enables adding hundreds of barcodes simultaneously
- Each barcode must maintain uniqueness across the workspace

## Access Requirements

Contact sales to enable this feature. It is a paid add-on requiring workspace admin activation for team deployment.
