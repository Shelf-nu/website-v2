This guide explains the different types of asset tags available in Shelf and the various methods for interacting with QR codes and asset labels.

## The Differences Between Linked and Unlinked Codes

You may wonder about the options for interacting with Shelf asset QR codes. This post covers all ways you can engage with your asset labels. Shelf offers two types of asset tags:

### Linked to Assets

These tags are created either by establishing a new asset in your personal or team workspace, or through CSV import. They connect directly to an asset in your database.

### Unlinked to Assets

These "orphaned" tags are not connected to any asset. They're typically used when users want to pre-purchase asset labels for inventory purposes on an individual asset basis.

## Scanning and Interacting with Tags

You can interact with your tags in the following ways:

- **Phone Camera Scanning**: Scan a QR code via your phone camera to display a URL linking to the correct asset in your database. Note: If you scan while not authenticated, you'll see a "contact owner" form requesting location permissions; messages go to the account owner's inbox.

- **In-app Scanner**: Use Shelf's built-in scanner to quickly scan codes without re-authentication, taking you directly to the asset with quick action options available.
