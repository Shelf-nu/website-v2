## The QR Code Swapping Feature

### How it works

1. Navigate to the asset page
2. Click the dropdown menu and select "Relink new code"
3. Use the camera to scan a new QR code
4. Confirm the swap

**Important:** Once you link a new code, the old code becomes unusable and won't lead to any asset.

## Types of QR Codes in Shelf

Two types of alternative codes exist in Shelf:

### Unlinked Codes

- These are codes that belong to your workspace but aren't attached to any asset
- You can request unlinked codes specific to your workspace

### Unclaimed Codes

- These are the codes used to generate asset labels for [the Shelf store](https://store.shelf.nu)
- They can be used to swap codes on existing assets or create new assets/kits
- If an asset using an unclaimed code is deleted, that code becomes available again for use in any workspace

## Scenarios and Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Swapping with an Unlinked Code

- You have "Asset A" with its original QR code
- You request an unlinked code for your workspace
- You swap Asset A's code with the new unlinked code
- **Result:** Asset A now has the new code, and the old code becomes unlinked (available for use with another asset in that workspace)

### Scenario 2: Swapping with an Unclaimed Code

- You have "Asset B" with its original QR code
- You have unclaimed codes from [the Shelf store](https://store.shelf.nu)
- You swap Asset B's code with an unclaimed code
- **Result:** Asset B now has the new code, and the old code becomes unusable

### Scenario 3: Deleting an Asset with an Unclaimed Code

- You create "Asset C" using an unclaimed code
- You later delete Asset C
- **Result:** The unclaimed code becomes available again for use in any workspace

## Best Practices and Tips

- Always double-check before swapping codes to ensure you're using the correct new code
- Keep track of your unlinked and unclaimed codes to maintain an organized system
- **Remember that swapping codes doesn't change any other asset information -- it only changes the QR code associated with the asset**

## Troubleshooting
