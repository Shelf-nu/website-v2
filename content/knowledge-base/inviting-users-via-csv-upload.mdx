## Overview

Shelf enables bulk user invitations through CSV file uploads, making it particularly useful for onboarding teams or departments all at once.

## Prerequisites

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to **Settings > Team**
2. Click on **Import Users**
3. Download the CSV template to ensure proper formatting
4. Fill in the template with user information

## CSV File Requirements

### Base Rules

- Use comma (,) as the delimiter
- Valid roles: ADMIN, BASE, SELF_SERVICE
- Role column is case-sensitive
- Each row represents one new user
- Email addresses must be valid
- First row reserved for column headers

### Required Columns

## After Import
