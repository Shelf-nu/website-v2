## Understanding the Process

Changing a user's role in Shelf requires revoking their current access and re-inviting them with the new role. This process preserves all asset assignments and historical data while allowing you to modify their permissions.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Revoke Current Access

1. Navigate to **Settings > Team**
2. Find the user whose role you want to change
3. Click on **Actions** next to their name
4. Select **Revoke access**

**Note:** When you revoke access, the user becomes a Non-Registered Member (NRM). This ensures that all assets and data associated with this user remain intact in your database.

### Step 2: Re-invite the User

1. Locate the user in the Non-Registered Members section
2. Click **Actions** next to their name
3. Select **Invite**
4. Choose the new role you want to assign
5. Confirm the invitation

### Step 3: Monitor Invitation Status

You can track pending invitations in the "Pending Invitations" tab under **Settings > Team**.

## Important Considerations

- During the transition period, the user will exist as a Non-Registered Member (NRM)
- All asset assignments and historical data are preserved throughout this process
- Once the user accepts the new invitation, they will automatically regain access to their associated assets
- The user will need to accept the new invitation to complete the role change
