# Hector Alternative

Hector is an equipment tracking platform aimed at enterprise and institutional environments, offering check-out management, maintenance scheduling, and audit reporting. Teams evaluating alternatives often want faster day-to-day workflows, stronger booking capabilities, and a more intuitive experience for the staff members who actually handle equipment.

## Overview: Hector vs Shelf

Hector provides a structured environment for tracking equipment across enterprise organizations. Its focus on administrative oversight includes features for depreciation tracking, vendor management, and maintenance scheduling—capabilities geared toward asset managers and procurement teams.

Shelf is designed for the operational layer of equipment management. Its focus is the daily interaction between people and gear: scanning a QR code to check something out, booking a camera kit for next week, transferring custody when shifts change, and verifying every component comes back. Shelf makes these moments frictionless.

## Where Shelf Takes a Different Approach

### 1. User-Facing Simplicity

Hector’s interface is built for administrators managing enterprise inventories. Shelf’s interface serves both administrators and end users—the student borrowing a laptop, the technician grabbing a tool, the coordinator reserving a projector. Everyone interacts through the same simple QR-based workflow.

---

### 2. QR Scan as the Primary Interface

Hector relies on dashboard navigation and search to manage equipment. Shelf makes the QR label on the equipment itself the entry point—scan it and the system presents exactly what you need: availability, booking options, custody actions, and history.

---

### 3. Real-Time Booking with Conflict Prevention

Hector offers reservation features, but Shelf’s booking system is purpose-built for high-frequency shared equipment environments. The calendar shows real-time availability, prevents double-bookings automatically, and handles recurring reservations for production schedules and academic terms.

See: [Bookings](/features/bookings)

---

### 4. Kit Management with Component Tracking

Enterprise tools often track assets as individual records in a database. Shelf adds a kit layer—grouping related equipment into units that are booked, checked out, and verified together. Missing a cable from a returned kit? Shelf flags it immediately.

See: [Kits](/features/kits)

---

### 5. Open Source and Transparent

Hector is proprietary enterprise software. Shelf is open source, allowing organizations to review the code, verify security practices, and self-host if their policies require it.

## When Teams Choose Shelf Instead of Hector

- **Universities and schools**: Students and staff need a simple, intuitive interface they can use without training
- **Media and production teams**: Kit-based workflows with booking and component verification are daily necessities
- **IT departments distributing devices**: Fast QR-based check-out is more efficient than navigating an enterprise dashboard
- **Multi-department organizations**: Workspaces give each team autonomy while maintaining organizational visibility
- **Teams wanting rapid deployment**: Get operational in days, not weeks of enterprise configuration

---

## When Hector May Be a Better Fit

- **Organizations needing vendor and procurement management**: Teams that want asset tracking tightly integrated with purchasing workflows
- **Maintenance-heavy environments**: Operations where scheduled preventive maintenance is a primary concern
- **Enterprise compliance requirements**: Organizations with strict reporting needs tied to asset depreciation and lifecycle
