# AssetGuru Alternative

AssetGuru positions itself as an enterprise-grade asset management platform with multi-level approval workflows, procurement tracking, and compliance-oriented audit trails. Teams exploring alternatives often find that layered approval chains slow down day-to-day equipment operations, especially when gear needs to move quickly between people and locations.

---

## Overview: AssetGuru vs Shelf

AssetGuru caters to organizations that require formal approval gates before assets can be checked out, transferred, or retired. Its strength lies in governance—ensuring every asset movement passes through the right stakeholders.

Shelf focuses on operational velocity. Instead of routing every check-out through approval chains, Shelf gives teams instant scan-to-act workflows where custody transfers, bookings, and returns happen in seconds. Governance is handled through visibility—audit trails, custody logs, and workspace-level permissions—rather than bottleneck-creating approval queues.

---

## Where Shelf Takes a Different Approach

### 1. Speed Over Approval Gates

AssetGuru requires requests to pass through one or more approvers before equipment changes hands. This works well for procurement but creates friction for daily equipment operations.

Shelf lets teams check out and return gear instantly via QR scan. Every transaction is logged automatically, giving managers full visibility without forcing staff to wait for approval on routine operations.

---

### 2. QR-First Field Operations

Shelf treats QR codes as the operational interface. Staff scan a code to see availability, check out an item, transfer custody, or flag an issue. No desktop login required, no approval forms to fill out.

---

### 3. Native Booking with Conflict Prevention

AssetGuru scheduling relies on approval workflows—someone requests an asset, a manager approves, and the reservation is confirmed. Shelf handles this with a real-time booking calendar that prevents double-bookings automatically, eliminating the approval bottleneck for reservations.

See: [Bookings](/features/bookings)

---

### 4. Kit-Level Management

Shelf tracks kits as logical groups—a camera body, two lenses, a tripod, and a case travel together as a single bookable unit. AssetGuru tracks assets individually, which means kit-based workflows require manual coordination.

See: [Kits](/features/kits)

---

### 5. Open-Source Transparency

Shelf is open source. Teams can inspect the code, verify how data is handled, and contribute improvements. Enterprise platforms like AssetGuru operate as closed systems where feature requests enter a backlog with no visibility into prioritization.

## When Teams Choose Shelf Instead of AssetGuru

- **Operations teams frustrated by approval delays**: Equipment that sits in a queue while waiting for approval creates downtime
- **Education departments with high equipment turnover**: Students and staff need gear fast, not after a three-step approval chain
- **Media teams managing kit-based workflows**: Kits need to be booked and tracked as units, not as individual line items
- **IT departments wanting lightweight check-out**: Laptop and device distribution should take seconds, not hours
- **Multi-location teams needing workspace separation**: Each site manages its own inventory without cross-department approval complexity

---

## When AssetGuru May Be a Better Fit

- **Procurement-heavy organizations**: Teams that need purchase order tracking, vendor management, and procurement approval workflows
- **Regulatory compliance environments**: Industries where every asset movement must be formally approved before it happens
- **Large enterprises with dedicated asset managers**: Organizations with full-time staff managing approval queues
