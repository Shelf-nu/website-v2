# Asset Infinity Alternative

Asset Infinity is an RFID-centric asset tracking platform designed for organizations that invest in radio-frequency identification hardware to automate asset discovery and auditing. Teams evaluating alternatives often discover that RFID infrastructure adds cost and complexity that outweighs its benefits for many operational environments.

---

## Overview: Asset Infinity vs Shelf

Asset Infinity builds its workflows around RFID readers, tags, and bulk-scan capabilities. The platform excels when organizations can install fixed readers at doorways and checkpoints, enabling passive tracking of tagged assets as they move through a facility.

Shelf takes a QR-first approach. Instead of requiring specialized hardware, Shelf turns every smartphone into a scanning device. Teams scan QR labels to check out equipment, transfer custody, update locations, and complete returns—all without purchasing RFID infrastructure.

## Where Shelf Takes a Different Approach

### 1. No Specialized Hardware Required

RFID systems require readers, antennas, and specialized tags—often costing thousands before tracking begins. Shelf generates QR labels that can be printed on any label printer, and any phone camera becomes the reader.

See: [Asset Tracking](/solutions/asset-tracking)

---

### 2. Scan to Act, Not Just Scan to Locate

Asset Infinity’s RFID approach answers "where is this asset?" Shelf’s QR codes go further—scanning triggers actions: check out, return, transfer custody, view booking history, or flag for maintenance.

---

### 3. Built-In Booking and Reservation System

Asset Infinity focuses on tracking and auditing. Shelf includes a native booking system that lets users reserve equipment in advance, see real-time availability, and prevent scheduling conflicts automatically.

See: [Bookings](/features/bookings)

---

### 4. Kit Tracking for Multi-Part Equipment

RFID tracks individual tags. Shelf tracks kits—logically grouped items that move together. Book a sound kit, and every component (mixer, microphones, cables, case) is assigned together and verified on return.

See: [Kits](/features/kits)

---

### 5. Workspace Isolation for Multi-Department Operations

Shelf’s workspaces let different departments maintain separate inventories with their own team members, categories, and workflows—while administrators see everything across the organization.

## When Teams Choose Shelf Instead of Asset Infinity

- **Teams without RFID budgets**: QR-first tracking eliminates hardware investment entirely
- **Organizations where assets leave the building**: RFID readers only work at fixed checkpoints; QR codes work anywhere a phone goes
- **Departments needing booking workflows**: Reservation and scheduling are core to their operations, not just location awareness
- **Media and education teams**: Kit-based workflows and student-facing check-out need simplicity over infrastructure
- **Growing teams that want to start immediately**: No installation, no hardware procurement, no integration delays

---

## When Asset Infinity May Be a Better Fit

- **Large warehouses with fixed entry/exit points**: Passive RFID scanning at doorways automates movement logging without human interaction
- **High-volume bulk auditing**: Scanning hundreds of RFID tags simultaneously during physical inventory counts
- **Organizations with existing RFID infrastructure**: Teams that have already invested in readers and tags
