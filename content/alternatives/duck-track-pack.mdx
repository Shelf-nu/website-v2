# DuckTrackPack Alternative

DuckTrackPack provides a basic equipment checkout system that helps small teams log who borrowed what. It covers the fundamental use case of lending and returning items, but teams managing larger inventories, shared schedules, or multi-part equipment sets need capabilities that go beyond simple checkout logs.

---

## Overview: DuckTrackPack vs Shelf

DuckTrackPack handles the core transaction: an item goes out, a name is recorded, and eventually it comes back. This simplicity appeals to teams just starting to formalize their equipment lending process.

Shelf covers the same core transaction but wraps it in a complete operational system. Before the checkout happens, users can browse availability and make bookings. During the checkout, QR scanning captures custody instantly. After the return, Shelf logs the full history and verifies kit completeness. For teams where equipment operations are a daily reality, this depth makes the difference between a checkout log and a functioning equipment management system.

## Where Shelf Takes a Different Approach

### 1. Booking Before Checkout

DuckTrackPack records checkouts as they happen. Shelf lets teams plan ahead with a booking calendar that shows availability, prevents conflicts, and reserves equipment for future dates—critical for production schedules and academic semesters.

See: [Bookings](/features/bookings)

---

### 2. QR-Powered Speed

Instead of manually searching for items and typing names, Shelf’s QR labels let users scan and act. One scan shows the item’s status, availability, custody history, and next booking—then lets the user check out or return with a tap.

---

### 3. Kit Tracking with Component Verification

DuckTrackPack tracks individual items. Shelf tracks kits—bundled equipment sets where every component matters. Check out a production kit, and Shelf knows what should be inside. Return it, and missing pieces are flagged immediately.

See: [Kits](/features/kits)

---

### 4. Multi-Department Scale

A single checkout log works for one team. Shelf’s workspaces let multiple departments—media, IT, facilities, athletics—each manage their own equipment pools independently while the organization maintains centralized oversight.

## When Teams Choose Shelf Instead of DuckTrackPack

- **University media programs**: Students booking cameras, audio gear, and lighting kits need scheduling and kit verification
- **Growing equipment pools**: When the number of items and users outgrows a basic checkout log
- **Teams with advance reservation needs**: Production schedules and project timelines require forward-looking booking
- **Organizations with multiple lending locations**: Workspace separation keeps each location’s inventory organized
- **Teams wanting accountability**: Full custody chains and audit trails provide clear responsibility records

---

## When DuckTrackPack May Be a Better Fit

- **Very small, informal lending**: A handful of items shared among a few trusted colleagues
- **Minimal tracking requirements**: Teams that only need to know who has what, with no scheduling or kit concerns
- **Budget-constrained pilot programs**: Organizations testing whether formalized checkout tracking is worthwhile before investing
