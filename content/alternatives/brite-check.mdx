# BriteCheck Alternative

BriteCheck focuses on field service asset management, helping organizations track tools and equipment assigned to technicians working across job sites. Its strength is connecting asset data to service operations. Teams looking for alternatives often need broader functionality—booking systems, kit tracking, and multi-department visibility—that goes beyond field service scenarios.

---

## Overview: BriteCheck vs Shelf

BriteCheck is built around the field technician’s workflow: assign tools to a truck, dispatch to a job site, and track what’s deployed where. The platform integrates with field service management systems to keep asset data in sync with work orders.

Shelf serves a wider range of equipment operations. While it handles field-deployed assets well, Shelf also manages shared equipment pools, booking schedules, kit-based workflows, and multi-department inventories. Its QR-first approach means any team member—field technician, office admin, or student—can interact with equipment through the same simple scan.

---

## Where Shelf Takes a Different Approach

### 1. Universal QR Operations

BriteCheck ties asset actions to field service workflows and dispatching tools. Shelf makes every asset operation accessible via QR scan—check out, return, transfer custody, view history—regardless of whether the user is in the field, in a warehouse, or in an office.

---

### 2. Equipment Booking for Shared Resources

Field service tools assume assets are assigned to individuals or vehicles. Shelf adds a booking layer for shared equipment—projectors, test instruments, vehicles—that multiple teams or technicians need to reserve in advance.

See: [Bookings](/features/bookings)

---

### 3. Kit-Based Tracking

Field technicians carry tool kits, not individual wrenches. Shelf models this reality with kit grouping: every component is tracked together, checked out together, and verified together on return. BriteCheck tracks items individually, leaving kit assembly to manual processes.

---

### 4. Multi-Department Workspaces

BriteCheck is designed for field service teams. Shelf’s workspaces support multiple departments within the same organization—field ops, warehouse, IT, training—each with their own inventory and workflows, while administrators maintain cross-department visibility.

## When Teams Choose Shelf Instead of BriteCheck

- **Organizations with both field and office equipment**: A single platform that covers all departments, not just field technicians
- **Teams needing reservation and scheduling**: Shared equipment pools require booking workflows that field service tools lack
- **Operations managing tool kits**: Kit-based check-out and return verification prevents lost components
- **Multi-department organizations**: IT, facilities, and operations all tracking equipment through one system with workspace separation
- **Teams wanting simpler onboarding**: QR-based scanning requires no specialized training or field service software integration

---

## When BriteCheck May Be a Better Fit

- **Pure field service operations**: Teams whose primary workflow is dispatching technicians with tools to job sites
- **Deep FSM integration needs**: Organizations that need asset data tightly coupled with work order and dispatching systems
- **Compliance-driven field operations**: Industries requiring service-specific documentation tied to each asset at every job site
