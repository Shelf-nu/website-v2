# QR Inventory Alternative

QR Inventory is a QR code-based inventory management system designed for tracking stock levels, managing warehouse operations, and handling purchase orders. Teams evaluating it for equipment management often discover that inventory management and equipment management solve different problems—one tracks quantities, the other tracks circulation.

---

## Overview: QR Inventory vs Shelf

QR Inventory uses QR codes to streamline warehouse and inventory operations: scanning items during receiving, picking, and shipping. It tracks stock quantities, reorder points, and warehouse locations—the supply chain side of physical goods management.

Shelf also uses QR codes but for a different purpose entirely. Shelf’s QR codes trigger equipment operations: check out this laptop, return this camera kit, book this projector for next Tuesday. The underlying model is custody and circulation, not inventory levels and reorder points.

---

## Where Shelf Takes a Different Approach

### 1. Circulation vs Consumption

QR Inventory tracks consumable goods that flow in one direction: purchased, stocked, sold or used. Shelf tracks durable equipment that circulates: checked out, used, returned, checked out again. Different item lifecycles require different management approaches.

See: [Custody](/features/custody)

---

### 2. QR Scans for Equipment Actions

QR Inventory scans update stock counts and warehouse locations. Shelf scans trigger user-facing workflows—check-out, return, custody transfer, availability check, and booking—designed for equipment that changes hands between people, not goods moving through a supply chain.

See: [Location Tracking](/features/location-tracking)

---

### 3. Equipment Booking and Scheduling

Inventory systems do not need booking features—stock is either available or it is not. Equipment systems depend on scheduling. Shelf’s booking calendar lets users reserve specific items for future dates, see who has them now, and plan around existing reservations.

See: [Bookings](/features/bookings)

---

### 4. Kit Grouping for Multi-Part Equipment

Inventory systems track items by SKU with quantities. Shelf tracks equipment kits—grouped items that are booked, dispatched, and returned as a logical unit with component-level verification on return.

See: [Kits](/features/kits)

---

### 5. Open-Source Equipment Platform

QR Inventory is proprietary software focused on warehouse operations. Shelf is open source, purpose-built for equipment management, with full code transparency and community-driven development.

---

## When Teams Choose Shelf Instead of QR Inventory

- **Teams managing reusable equipment**: Items that circulate between people need custody workflows, not stock-level tracking
- **Organizations with scheduling needs**: Shared equipment requires advance booking and conflict prevention
- **Departments tracking kits**: Multi-component equipment sets need grouped management, not individual SKU counts
- **Teams wanting user-facing simplicity**: End users need to scan and act—not navigate a warehouse management interface
- **Multi-department organizations**: Workspaces give each team its own equipment view within one platform

---

## When QR Inventory May Be a Better Fit

- **Warehouse and stockroom management**: Tracking quantities of consumable items with reorder points and purchase orders
- **Manufacturing and production**: Managing raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods inventory
- **Retail and distribution**: Businesses that ship products to customers and need stock-level accuracy across locations
