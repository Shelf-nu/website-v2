# Cheqroom Alternative

Teams evaluating equipment management software often compare Cheqroom and Shelf. Both serve organizations that need to track shared equipment, manage bookings, and maintain accountability—but they take different approaches to solving these problems.

---

## Overview: Cheqroom vs Shelf

Cheqroom is widely used for equipment rooms and lending workflows, particularly in media, education, and corporate environments. It provides a comprehensive set of features for managing reservations, tracking items, and handling check-in/check-out processes.

Shelf takes a different approach, focusing on simplicity, QR-first workflows, and clear accountability across teams. Shelf prioritizes fast adoption, minimal configuration, and unified workflows that connect bookings, custody, and location tracking in one streamlined system.

---

## Where Shelf Takes a Different Approach

### 1. Workflow-First Over Configuration

Shelf emphasizes getting started quickly with minimal setup:

- **Quick scanning**: QR-based workflows that anyone can use immediately
- **Simple check-in/out**: Fast, intuitive transactions without complex training
- **Intuitive UI**: Clean interface designed for speed and clarity
- **Minimal setup**: Start tracking equipment in minutes, not weeks

---

### 2. Unified Bookings + Custody

In Shelf, bookings and custody work together in a single workflow. When a reservation begins, custody transfers automatically. When equipment is returned, both systems update instantly—no separate processes to maintain.

---

### 3. Simpler Kit Management

Shelf handles accessories and kit components with a straightforward parent-child structure. Book a camera kit, and all its accessories follow. Return it, and Shelf flags what's missing. No complex configuration required.

See: [Kits](/features/kits)

---

### 4. Locations & Field Operations

Shelf provides clear multi-site tracking with hierarchical locations. Teams can track equipment across buildings, rooms, job sites, and vehicles—with fast QR-based updates that work well for field operations.

See: [Location Tracking](/features/location-tracking)

---

### 5. Multi-Department Structure via Workspaces

Shelf separates inventories cleanly by department, program, or location. Each workspace operates independently while administrators retain visibility across the organization.

See: [Workspaces](/features/workspaces)

---

## When Teams Choose Shelf Instead

Teams often choose Shelf when they prioritize:

- **Education programs**: Simple workflows that students can adopt without training
- **Film and media teams**: Fast check-outs that don't slow down production schedules
- **IT departments**: Clear custody trails for device accountability
- **Field operations**: Location tracking across job sites and vehicles

These teams value speed, simplicity, and workflows that match how they actually work.

---

## When Cheqroom May Be a Better Fit

Cheqroom may suit teams better when:

- **Organizations need specific customizations** that Cheqroom's configuration options support
- **Teams are already invested in Cheqroom** and have built workflows around its feature set
- **Certain industry-specific requirements** align more closely with Cheqroom's approach

Both tools serve equipment management needs—the right choice depends on your team's priorities and workflows.
