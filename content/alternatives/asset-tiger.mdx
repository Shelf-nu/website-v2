# AssetTiger Alternative

AssetTiger offers free cloud-based asset tracking that appeals to teams getting started with digital inventory management. It provides basic features like barcode scanning, check-in/check-out, and depreciation tracking at no cost. Teams outgrowing AssetTiger typically need deeper workflows—bookings, kit management, custody chains—that free tools were never designed to handle.

---

## Overview: AssetTiger vs Shelf

AssetTiger gives small teams a no-cost way to catalog assets, assign them to people or locations, and track basic check-out activity. It covers the fundamentals well for teams that primarily need a digital register.

Shelf is built for equipment that moves. Beyond cataloging, Shelf provides operational workflows: scan-to-act QR codes, real-time booking calendars, custody transfer chains, kit grouping, and multi-department workspaces. Teams choose Shelf when tracking is not enough—they need to manage how equipment flows between people and places.

## Where Shelf Takes a Different Approach

### 1. Beyond the Asset Register

AssetTiger excels as a digital catalog—listing what you own, where it is, and who has it. Shelf builds on that foundation with operational layers: who booked it next, what kit it belongs to, when it’s due back, and what its full custody history looks like.

---

### 2. QR Codes That Trigger Workflows

AssetTiger uses barcodes for identification. Shelf’s QR codes are interactive—scanning opens a context-aware page where users can check out, return, transfer, view history, or make a booking, all from their phone.

---

### 3. Real-Time Equipment Booking

AssetTiger does not include a booking or reservation system. Shelf’s built-in calendar shows real-time availability and prevents double-bookings, which is essential for shared equipment environments like production houses, universities, and IT departments.

See: [Bookings](/features/bookings)

---

### 4. Kit and Accessory Management

Free tools typically track assets as flat lists. Shelf groups related items into kits with parent-child relationships—book the kit, and every accessory is included. Return the kit, and Shelf verifies each component.

See: [Kits](/features/kits)

---

### 5. Open Source with a Growth Path

AssetTiger is free but closed-source, meaning teams have no visibility into development priorities or data handling. Shelf is open source, giving teams full transparency and the ability to self-host if needed.

---

## When Teams Choose Shelf Instead of AssetTiger

- **Teams outgrowing spreadsheets and free tools**: When basic tracking no longer covers operational needs
- **Departments that share equipment daily**: Booking, custody, and return workflows become essential at scale
- **Organizations managing kits and accessories**: Grouped equipment needs to travel and be tracked as units
- **Growing teams that need workspace separation**: Multiple departments or locations each managing their own gear
- **Teams wanting long-term reliability**: Open-source transparency provides confidence that the platform will evolve

---

## When AssetTiger May Be a Better Fit

- **Very small teams with minimal budgets**: Organizations that need basic cataloging and cannot invest in any tooling
- **Static asset registers**: Teams tracking assets that rarely move or change hands
- **Depreciation-focused accounting**: Organizations primarily interested in financial asset tracking rather than operational workflows
