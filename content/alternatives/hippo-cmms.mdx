# Hippo CMMS Alternative

Hippo CMMS is a maintenance and facility management system focused on work orders, preventive maintenance, and asset service history. Some teams evaluate alternatives when they need simpler equipment tracking rather than full CMMS structure.

---

## Overview: Hippo CMMS vs Shelf

Hippo CMMS belongs to the **CMMS** category—built for work orders, asset maintenance scheduling, and service documentation.

Shelf belongs to the **equipment tracking and operations** category—built for check-outs, custody, bookings, and equipment movement between people and places.

Both serve different operational needs. The right choice depends on whether maintenance management or equipment movement is your primary challenge.

---

## Where Shelf Takes a Different Approach

### 1. Lightweight, Workflow-First Design

Shelf is optimized for daily equipment operations:

- Quick check-outs and returns
- Location updates across sites
- Kit and accessory handling
- Custody tracking with automatic logging

No complex configuration required—teams start tracking immediately.

### 2. QR-Based Daily Operations

Shelf uses QR codes as the primary interface. Scan to check out, return, or transfer custody—all in seconds.

### 3. Built-In Reservations

Shelf includes conflict-free booking for shared equipment. Users see real-time availability and reserve items ahead of time.

---

### 4. Multi-Department Use

Education, IT, media, and operations teams can all use Shelf with workspace separation—no complicated setup.

## When Shelf Is a Better Fit

Shelf may be a better choice when your focus is equipment movement:

- Shared AV or IT equipment with frequent check-outs
- Student or rotating staff environments
- Field tools moving between locations and crews
- Teams wanting simple tracking without CMMS administration

---

## When Hippo CMMS May Be the Better Fit

Hippo CMMS may be a better choice when maintenance is central:

- Facility teams needing structured work orders
- Environments with recurring preventive maintenance schedules
- Operations requiring detailed service records and compliance documentation
