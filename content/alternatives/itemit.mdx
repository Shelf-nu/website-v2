# Itemit Alternative

Itemit is a mobile-first asset tracking app that makes it easy to tag, scan, and locate assets from a smartphone. Its polished mobile experience appeals to teams that want to manage inventory on the go. Teams exploring alternatives often need deeper operational features—equipment booking, kit management, and multi-department isolation—that go beyond mobile scanning and tagging.

---

## Overview: Itemit vs Shelf

Itemit builds its experience around the mobile app. Users add assets by snapping photos, scanning barcodes, and attaching details from their phones. The platform covers tagging, location logging, and basic check-in/check-out with a consumer-grade mobile interface.

Shelf is also mobile-friendly, but its design philosophy is different. Shelf treats QR codes as operational triggers—not just identification tags. Scanning a Shelf QR code opens a workflow: check out, return, book, transfer, or verify a kit. The mobile experience is a means to faster operations, not an end in itself.

---

## Where Shelf Takes a Different Approach

### 1. QR Codes That Drive Workflows

Itemit uses scans for identification and location updates. Shelf uses scans to trigger actions—a single scan surfaces the item’s status, upcoming bookings, custody history, and lets the user complete a transaction immediately.

See: [Custody](/features/custody)

---

### 2. Equipment Booking and Availability

Itemit does not offer a built-in booking system. Shelf’s booking calendar shows real-time availability for every asset, lets users reserve equipment for specific dates, and prevents double-bookings automatically—essential for shared equipment environments.

See: [Bookings](/features/bookings)

---

### 3. Kit Management with Verification

Itemit tracks individual assets. Shelf groups assets into kits where components are tracked together. Check out a video production kit, and every item inside is assigned. Return it, and missing pieces are flagged before the kit goes to the next user.

See: [Kits](/features/kits)

---

### 4. Workspace Separation for Departments

Itemit provides a single organizational view. Shelf’s workspaces let departments—IT, media, facilities, athletics—maintain independent inventories with their own teams, categories, and workflows, while administrators retain full cross-department visibility.

See: [Workspaces](/features/workspaces)

---

### 5. Open Source with Full Transparency

Itemit is a closed-source mobile app. Shelf is open source, meaning teams can review the codebase, understand data handling, and even self-host the platform for complete control over their equipment data.

---

## When Teams Choose Shelf Instead of Itemit

- **Teams needing equipment scheduling**: Booking and availability tracking are central to shared equipment operations
- **Organizations managing multi-part equipment**: Kit workflows—booking, checking out, and verifying grouped items—are not possible with flat asset lists
- **Multi-department institutions**: Universities, hospitals, and large companies need workspace isolation, not a single shared view
- **Operations wanting workflow depth**: Custody chains, audit trails, and return verification go beyond mobile asset tagging
- **Teams that value open-source control**: Code transparency and self-hosting options matter for data governance

---

## When Itemit May Be a Better Fit

- **Small teams wanting a polished mobile app**: Teams that primarily value a sleek smartphone experience for casual asset tracking
- **Simple tagging and location logging**: Organizations whose main need is knowing where assets are, not managing their circulation
- **Quick-start with minimal setup**: Teams that want to snap photos and start tracking within minutes
