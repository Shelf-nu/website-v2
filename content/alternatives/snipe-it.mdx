## Why choose Shelf over Snipe-IT?

Snipe-IT is a powerful open-source tool, but it can be complex to set up and maintain. Its interface often feels dated and clunky for non-technical users.

Shelf offers the same power but wrapped in a beautiful, modern interface that anyone can use without training. We prioritize ease of use and mobile accessibility, making it perfect for distributed teams.
