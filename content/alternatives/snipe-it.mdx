# Snipe-IT Alternative

Snipe-IT is a popular open-source IT asset management system used by technical teams that prefer full control over their infrastructure. But many IT departments look for a simpler, hosted solution — without the burden of server maintenance, updates, or custom development.

Shelf provides a modern, workflow-first platform designed for fast onboarding, clean check-out processes, and clear device accountability.

## Why Teams Look for a Snipe-IT Alternative

Organizations move away from Snipe-IT when they want:

- a hosted solution (no servers, no patching)  
- a clean, modern interface  
- faster onboarding for non-technical staff  
- built-in check-out / return workflows  
- custody tracking  
- simple location updates  
- better fit for education, media, and IT loaner programs  
- automation without writing extensions  

Teams often say:  
**“Snipe-IT is powerful, but too heavy for our real workflows.”**
