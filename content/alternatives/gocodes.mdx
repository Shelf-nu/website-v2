# GoCodes Alternative

GoCodes pioneered QR code-based asset tracking, offering patented labels that link physical assets to digital records. Scanning a GoCodes tag reveals asset details and automatically captures GPS location. Teams exploring alternatives find that while GoCodes solves the identification and location problem, it stops short of the operational workflows—bookings, custody chains, kits—that make equipment management work day to day.

---

## Overview: GoCodes vs Shelf

GoCodes treats QR codes as identification and location tools. Scan a tag, see the asset’s details, log its GPS coordinates. The platform answers "what is this?" and "where is it?" effectively.

Shelf treats QR codes as operational triggers. Scan a label to check out, return, transfer custody, view booking availability, or flag for maintenance. Shelf answers not just "what and where" but "who has it, who needs it next, and what else is in the kit." The QR code becomes the starting point for action, not just information retrieval.

## Where Shelf Takes a Different Approach

### 1. QR Scan Triggers Actions, Not Just Records

GoCodes scans pull up asset information and log location. Shelf scans open a context-aware interface: the user sees current status, upcoming bookings, custody history, and can immediately perform check-out, return, or transfer operations.

See: [Custody](/features/custody)

---

### 2. Booking and Scheduling Workflows

GoCodes does not include equipment reservation features. Shelf’s booking calendar lets teams reserve assets in advance, view real-time availability across the inventory, and prevent scheduling conflicts without manual coordination.

See: [Bookings](/features/bookings)

---

### 3. Kit Tracking Beyond Individual Tags

GoCodes tags individual items. Shelf groups tagged items into kits—related assets that travel, get booked, and get verified as a unit. A surveying kit with a total station, tripod, prism, and carrying case is managed as one bookable entity.

See: [Kits](/features/kits)

---

### 4. Multi-Department Workspaces

GoCodes provides a single organizational view. Shelf’s workspaces let different teams—construction, IT, facilities, operations—each manage their own equipment independently while the organization maintains visibility across all departments.

See: [Workspaces](/features/workspaces)

---

### 5. Open-Source Platform

GoCodes is a proprietary system with patented labels. Shelf is open source, using standard QR codes that teams can print on any label stock. No vendor lock-in on the labels themselves.

---

## When Teams Choose Shelf Instead of GoCodes

- **Teams needing workflows, not just identification**: Knowing what an asset is and where it was scanned is only the beginning—teams need check-out, return, and booking workflows
- **Organizations managing shared equipment**: Multiple users competing for the same gear need a booking system, not just a tag system
- **Operations tracking kits and accessories**: Multi-part equipment requires grouped management, not individual tag scanning
- **Multi-site organizations**: Different locations need independent inventory management with centralized reporting
- **Teams wanting standard QR codes**: No proprietary label requirements or vendor lock-in

---

## When GoCodes May Be a Better Fit

- **GPS location logging is the primary goal**: Teams whose main need is capturing where assets are scanned across a geographic area
- **Simple asset identification**: Organizations that primarily need to link physical items to digital records without operational workflows
- **Construction site asset auditing**: Teams focused on verifying asset presence at job sites rather than managing equipment circulation
