# Asset Panda Alternative

Asset Panda is known for its highly configurable asset management platform, offering flexibility through customizable templates and fields. Teams exploring alternatives often want simpler workflows, fewer configuration steps, and faster adoption across all staff—especially in environments where equipment moves frequently.

---

## Overview: Asset Panda vs Shelf

Asset Panda provides a broad feature set with customizable templates that organizations can tailor to their specific tracking needs. It offers flexibility for teams that want to define their own data structures and workflows.

Shelf takes a different approach, focusing on operational equipment workflows—check-outs, bookings, custody, kits, and the movement of gear between people and places. It prioritizes speed and simplicity for teams that need equipment tracking to work immediately, with minimal setup.

---

## Where Shelf Takes a Different Approach

### 1. Workflow-First vs Configuration-First

Asset Panda emphasizes customizable forms, fields, and modules—giving teams control over how they structure their asset data.

Shelf emphasizes fast, ready-to-use workflows for equipment that moves frequently. Instead of building custom forms, teams start tracking immediately with built-in workflows for custody, bookings, and location updates.

---

### 2. Designed for Shared Equipment Environments

Shelf is built for environments where equipment changes hands constantly:

- Frequent check-outs and returns
- Student and crew usage patterns
- Rotating staff and shift changes
- Minimal training requirements

These scenarios benefit from workflows that just work—without extensive configuration.

---

### 3. QR-First Operational Speed

Shelf uses QR codes as the primary interface for equipment operations. Scan to check out, scan to return, scan to transfer custody—all in seconds.

See: [Location Tracking](/features/location-tracking)

---

### 4. Built-In Bookings

Shelf includes native booking functionality that prevents double-bookings by design. Users see real-time availability and reserve equipment with conflict-free scheduling.

See: [Bookings](/features/bookings)

---

### 5. Kits and Accessory Tracking

Shelf tracks accessories and components with parent-child relationships. Book a camera kit, and all its accessories follow. Return it, and Shelf flags what's missing.

See: [Kits](/features/kits)

---

### 6. Multi-Department Support with Workspaces

Shelf separates inventories by department, program, or location. Each workspace manages its own equipment while administrators retain visibility across the organization.

See: [Workspaces](/features/workspaces)

## When Teams Choose Shelf Instead of Asset Panda

Teams often choose Shelf when they value speed and simplicity:

- **Teams tired of over-configuring templates**: Ready-to-use workflows without extensive setup
- **Universities with frequent student turnover**: Simple interfaces that new users adopt immediately
- **Media programs managing kits and accessories**: Kit-aware tracking that keeps components together
- **IT teams wanting simpler check-out flows**: Fast transactions without complex form submissions
- **Operations teams needing fast scanning + custody**: QR-based workflows for field and floor operations

These teams need equipment tracking that works immediately—not a platform that requires months of configuration.

---

## When Asset Panda May Be a Better Fit

Asset Panda may suit teams better when:

- **Deep customization is required**: Organizations that need to define their own data structures and workflows
- **Static assets with complex data**: Environments tracking assets that don't move frequently but require detailed records
- **Highly structured administrative control**: Teams that prefer building custom forms and approval workflows

Both tools serve asset management needs—the right choice depends on whether your priority is configurability or operational speed.
