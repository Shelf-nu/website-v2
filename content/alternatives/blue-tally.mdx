# BlueTally Alternative

BlueTally is a simple asset tracking tool designed for small teams that need to know what they own and who has it. Its straightforward interface makes it easy to get started, but teams that need scheduling, kits, or multi-department visibility quickly discover its limitations.

---

## Overview: BlueTally vs Shelf

BlueTally focuses on clarity and ease of use for small inventories. Teams add assets, assign them to people, and track their status. The interface stays clean because the feature set stays minimal.

Shelf shares that commitment to usability but extends it to operational depth. Teams get the same fast onboarding plus booking calendars, custody workflows, kit tracking, QR-powered field operations, and workspace separation for departments. Shelf scales from small teams to complex multi-location organizations without forcing a platform switch.

## Where Shelf Takes a Different Approach

### 1. Built for Growth

BlueTally works well at small scale but lacks the operational features teams need as they grow: bookings, kits, custody chains, and role-based access. Shelf provides these from day one, so teams never hit a ceiling.

See: [Workspaces](/features/workspaces)

---

### 2. QR Codes as Operational Interfaces

BlueTally tracks assets through its web interface. Shelf puts QR labels on equipment and turns every scan into an action—check out, return, transfer, or book. This eliminates the need to search for assets in a dashboard.

---

### 3. Equipment Booking and Scheduling

BlueTally does not offer reservation or booking features. Shelf includes a real-time booking calendar with automatic conflict detection, letting teams schedule equipment in advance and avoid double-bookings.

See: [Bookings](/features/bookings)

---

### 4. Kit Grouping for Complex Equipment

Small teams often manage multi-part equipment sets—a camera rig, a tool kit, a presentation setup. Shelf groups these into kits where every component is tracked together: booked together, checked out together, verified on return together.

## When Teams Choose Shelf Instead of BlueTally

- **Growing teams hitting feature limits**: When simple tracking is no longer enough and booking or custody workflows become necessary
- **Education programs scaling up**: Media labs, theatre departments, and IT lending programs need features BlueTally does not offer
- **Teams managing shared equipment pools**: Scheduling and availability tracking are essential when multiple people need the same gear
- **Multi-department organizations**: Workspace separation lets each team manage its own inventory with organization-wide oversight
- **Operations that rely on field scanning**: QR-first workflows let staff operate without opening a browser

---

## When BlueTally May Be a Better Fit

- **Very small teams with basic needs**: Five people tracking twenty items may not need booking or kit features
- **Teams that value extreme simplicity above all**: Organizations that prefer fewer features over more capable workflows
- **Short-term or temporary tracking needs**: Pop-up projects where a lightweight tool is sufficient
