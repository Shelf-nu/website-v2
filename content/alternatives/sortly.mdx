# Sortly Alternative

Sortly is a popular inventory tool for managing items in warehouses, storerooms, and general asset lists. But teams that operate with shared equipment — cameras, tools, laptops, AV gear, or lab kits — often need workflows that go far beyond inventory.

Shelf is designed specifically for operational environments where assets move between people, places, and time.

## Why Teams Look for a Sortly Alternative

Organizations typically move away from Sortly when they require:

- bookings and reservations  
- check-out/check-in workflows  
- kits for bundled equipment  
- custody and responsibility tracking  
- location updates across campuses or job sites  
- better support for education, media, and field operations  
- modern, clean UX that users adopt quickly  

Sortly tracks items.  
Shelf tracks *workflows*.
