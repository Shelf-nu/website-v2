# Sortly Alternative

Teams looking for equipment tracking software often evaluate Sortly alongside other options. If you're considering alternatives, Shelf offers a different approach—focused on operational workflows for shared equipment rather than static inventory management.

---

## Overview: Sortly vs Shelf

Sortly is known for inventory-style tracking with folders, visual organization, and a consumer-friendly interface. It works well for cataloging items and maintaining structured lists.

Shelf takes a different approach, optimized for equipment that moves between people and places. It emphasizes fast check-in/out workflows, built-in bookings, custody tracking, and real-world operational movement—designed for teams that share equipment across users, departments, and locations.

---

## Where Shelf Takes a Different Approach

### 1. Workflow-Based vs Inventory-Based

Sortly emphasizes lists, folders, and visual organization—ideal for static inventory structures where items are cataloged and stored.

Shelf is optimized for equipment that moves constantly: shared cameras, loaner laptops, field tools, and production gear. It tracks not just what you have, but who has it, where it is, and when it's due back.

---

### 2. QR-First Operations

Shelf uses QR codes as the primary interface for field and operational workflows. Scan to check out, scan to return, scan to update location—all in seconds.

---

### 3. Built-In Bookings for Shared Equipment

Shelf includes native booking functionality for scheduling shared assets. Users can reserve equipment ahead of time with conflict-free scheduling—no separate calendar or reservation system required.

See: [Bookings](/features/bookings)

---

### 4. Kit-Aware Asset Management

Shelf tracks accessories and components with parent-child relationships. Book a camera kit, and all its lenses, batteries, and cables follow. Return it, and Shelf flags what's missing.

---

### 5. Multi-Department Friendly with Workspaces

Shelf separates inventories by department, program, or location. Each workspace manages its own equipment and users while administrators retain visibility across the organization.

## When Teams Choose Shelf Instead of Sortly

Teams often choose Shelf when their equipment moves constantly and accountability matters:

- **Universities managing student gear**: Simple workflows that students adopt without training
- **Media programs with kits and accessories**: Kit-aware tracking that keeps components together
- **IT teams with loaners and peripherals**: Clear custody trails for device accountability
- **Field teams needing responsibility tracking**: QR-based handoffs during shifts and site changes
- **Organizations where equipment moves constantly**: Real-time visibility into who has what

These teams need more than inventory lists—they need operational workflows.

---

## When Sortly May Be a Better Fit

Sortly may work well for teams when:

- **Equipment is mostly static**: Items are stored and cataloged rather than checked out regularly
- **Visual organization is the priority**: Folder-based structures with photos suit the workflow
- **Shared equipment workflows aren't needed**: No bookings, custody, or multi-user handoffs required

Both tools serve different use cases—the right choice depends on how your equipment actually moves through your organization.
