# Timly Alternative

Timly is an asset tracking platform that emphasizes GPS capabilities and real-time location monitoring alongside standard asset management features. Teams evaluating alternatives often find that while GPS tracking is appealing, the operational workflows they actually need—fast check-outs, booking systems, kit management—matter more than knowing an asset’s exact coordinates.

---

## Overview: Timly vs Shelf

Timly positions GPS and Bluetooth tracking as key differentiators, offering real-time location data for assets equipped with tracking hardware. The platform also includes maintenance scheduling, document management, and responsibility assignment features.

Shelf focuses on what happens when humans interact with equipment. Instead of passive GPS monitoring, Shelf’s QR-first approach makes every interaction intentional and productive: scan to check out, scan to return, scan to see who booked it next. Location is captured as part of the workflow, not as a separate hardware-dependent system.

## Where Shelf Takes a Different Approach

### 1. Workflow Over Surveillance

Timly’s GPS approach monitors where assets are. Shelf’s QR approach manages what people do with assets. Knowing a laptop is in Building C is less useful than knowing Sarah checked it out at 9 AM, it’s due back at 5 PM, and Marcus has it booked tomorrow.

---

### 2. No Hardware Dependencies

GPS and Bluetooth tracking require batteries, beacons, or trackers attached to every asset. Shelf uses printed QR labels—no batteries, no signal range limitations, no per-asset hardware costs. Every smartphone becomes the reader.

---

### 3. Purpose-Built Booking System

Timly includes basic scheduling features. Shelf’s booking system is designed for high-frequency shared equipment environments: real-time availability calendars, automatic double-booking prevention, and multi-day reservation support for production planning and academic scheduling.

See: [Bookings](/features/bookings)

---

### 4. Kit Tracking and Component Verification

Timly tracks assets individually. Shelf groups related equipment into kits that are booked, checked out, and verified as units. When a returned kit is missing a component, Shelf flags it before the next user picks it up.

See: [Kits](/features/kits)

---

### 5. Open-Source Platform

Timly is proprietary SaaS. Shelf is open source, giving teams full visibility into the codebase, data handling, and the ability to self-host. No vendor lock-in, no opaque pricing tiers based on GPS feature access.

## When Teams Choose Shelf Instead of Timly

- **Teams where custody matters more than coordinates**: Knowing who has equipment is more actionable than knowing where it is on a map
- **Budget-conscious operations**: QR labels cost pennies; GPS trackers cost dollars per asset with ongoing hardware maintenance
- **Shared equipment environments**: Booking and scheduling are daily needs that GPS platforms treat as secondary features
- **Kit-based operations**: Production, education, and field teams managing grouped equipment need kit-level workflows
- **Organizations wanting simplicity**: QR scan workflows require no additional hardware, no beacon infrastructure, no battery management

---

## When Timly May Be a Better Fit

- **High-value mobile assets**: Vehicles, heavy machinery, or equipment that moves between distant locations where real-time GPS tracking prevents theft or loss
- **Unmanned asset monitoring**: Scenarios where assets need to be located without human interaction—no one scanning QR codes
- **Fleet and logistics operations**: Vehicle tracking and route monitoring where GPS data feeds into logistics optimization
