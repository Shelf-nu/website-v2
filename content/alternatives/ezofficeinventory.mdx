# EZOfficeInventory Alternative

EZOfficeInventory is an office equipment and IT asset tracking platform with integrations into help desk tools like Zendesk and Jira. It is designed for IT teams managing laptops, monitors, and office peripherals. Teams exploring alternatives often need equipment operations that extend beyond IT—covering shared gear, production equipment, and field tools with booking and kit workflows.

---

## Overview: EZOfficeInventory vs Shelf

EZOfficeInventory positions itself at the intersection of asset tracking and IT service management. Its help desk integrations let support agents see which assets are assigned to a user when resolving tickets, and its maintenance scheduling helps IT teams plan device refreshes.

Shelf focuses on the operational side of equipment management. Rather than integrating with ticketing systems, Shelf optimizes the physical workflows—scanning, checking out, booking, returning, and transferring custody. For organizations where equipment moves between people daily, Shelf’s approach reduces friction at every touchpoint.

## Where Shelf Takes a Different Approach

### 1. QR-First Over Dashboard-First

EZOfficeInventory centers its operations on a web dashboard where administrators manage assets. Shelf puts the power at the point of interaction—staff scan a QR code on the equipment itself and complete their action on the spot.

---

### 2. Booking System Built for Shared Equipment

EZOfficeInventory offers basic reservation features, but its primary model is assignment—one laptop assigned to one employee. Shelf’s booking system is designed for shared pools: multiple users reserving the same projector, camera, or test instrument across different days and shifts.

---

### 3. Cross-Department, Not Just IT

EZOfficeInventory serves IT departments well. Shelf serves the whole organization—IT, media production, facilities, education, and operations—with workspaces that give each department its own inventory view while maintaining organizational oversight.

---

### 4. Kit Management for Multi-Part Equipment

IT teams lend individual devices. Production teams, labs, and field operations lend kits. Shelf groups related items—laptop, charger, dock, and bag—into a single bookable unit, tracking every component through the full custody cycle.

See: [Kits](/features/kits)

---

### 5. Open-Source Foundation

EZOfficeInventory is a proprietary SaaS product. Shelf is open source, meaning teams can audit the code, understand exactly how their data is handled, and contribute to the platform’s development.

## When Teams Choose Shelf Instead of EZOfficeInventory

- **Multi-department organizations**: IT, media, facilities, and operations all need equipment tracking—not just the help desk team
- **Teams with shared equipment pools**: Projectors, cameras, and instruments need booking workflows, not just assignment tracking
- **Operations managing kits**: Multi-part equipment sets need to be tracked as units, not as individual line items
- **Teams wanting QR-based field workflows**: Staff in the field or on the floor need to scan and act without logging into a dashboard
- **Organizations valuing open-source transparency**: Code visibility and community-driven development matter

---

## When EZOfficeInventory May Be a Better Fit

- **IT-only asset management**: Teams whose scope is limited to laptops, monitors, and IT peripherals
- **Help desk integration requirements**: Organizations that need asset data inside Zendesk, Jira, or similar ticketing tools
- **Maintenance and lifecycle management focus**: Teams primarily tracking device warranties, refresh cycles, and maintenance schedules
