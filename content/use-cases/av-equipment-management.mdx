# AV Equipment Management

AV teams manage high-value equipment that moves constantly between students, staff, technicians, and locations. Shelf provides a clean, workflow-first way to track usage, prevent loss, and keep accessories organized.

---

## Challenges in AV Teams

AV departments typically experience:

- missing accessories (batteries, cables, mics)
- double-booked cameras or kits
- manual calendars that fail under pressure
- no clear trail of responsibility
- inconsistent check-out processes
- last-minute studio chaos

---

## How Shelf Solves AV Equipment Management

### **1. QR-First Identification**
Scan a camera, mic, or lighting case to instantly view:

- accessories
- availability
- booking schedule
- custody history

See: [Asset Tracking](/solutions/asset-tracking)

---

### **2. Conflict-Free Bookings**
Students and staff reserve equipment without double-bookings.

See: [Bookings](/features/bookings)

---

### **3. Custody Tracking for Accountability**
Shelf automatically assigns responsibility when equipment is checked out.

See: [Custody](/features/custody)

---

### **4. Kit & Accessory Tracking**
AV kits often include microphones, lenses, clamps, cables, batteries, and stands.
Shelf flags missing components and keeps kits together.

See: [Kits](/features/kits)

---

### **5. Maintenance and Repairs**
AV gear requires cleaning, calibration, and battery replacements.
Shelf schedules reminders and logs service.
