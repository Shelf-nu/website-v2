# Check-In / Check-Out

Check-in/check-out is a workflow used to track who has equipment, when it was borrowed, and when it is returned.

---

## Why It Matters

Prevents loss, improves accountability, and ensures consistent workflows.

---

## How It Works

1. Scan the asset (QR code)  
2. Assign custody  
3. Track due dates or bookings  
4. Return the item with a scan  
5. Flag issues or missing accessories
